#Introduction

In this lab you'll put the view model into its own class.

#Steps


??Create the view model

Use `npm run create-class` to create`Yelp.view.MainViewModel` that extends `model/Component`.

??Use it

Move the `data` property from the main view to the view model.

Then import the view model, and change the `model` config to use the new class.

??Create and use a controller

We don't need controller logic yet, but we will, so while we're at it, create a
`Yelp.view.MainViewController` that extends `controller/Component`. Import it in the 
main view, and configure a controller block to use it.

    controller: {
        module: MainViewController
    }
