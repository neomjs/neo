# Ticket: Restructure BACKERS.md into an Investment Prospectus

GH ticket id: #7434

**Assignee:** tobiu
**Status:** Done

## Description

The `BACKERS.md` file has been completely rewritten and restructured into an "Investment Prospectus" to create a more compelling and professional appeal for potential sponsors.

## Changes
1.  **Lead with the Vision:** The file now opens with a strong statement about sponsoring the future of web development.
2.  **Clear Sponsorship Tiers:** A detailed "menu" of the available GitHub sponsorship tiers has been added directly into the document.
3.  **Connect Sponsorship to Roadmap:** The "Why Sponsor?" section has been reframed as "What Your Sponsorship Funds," explicitly linking contributions to key roadmap initiatives like the Sighted Agent and AI-native tooling.
4.  **Removed Stale Offers:** The outdated "Special Offer" was removed to present a cleaner, more confident appeal.
5.  **Modernized Tone:** The overall tone has been shifted from a personal appeal to a professional investment opportunity.
