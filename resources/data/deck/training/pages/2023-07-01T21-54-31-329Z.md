Keep in mind that `Neo.manager.Component.items`, `Neo.find()` and `Neo.findFirst()`
are debugging aids _only_, and _should never be used in app logic_.

Why? There's nothing stopping you from using then, and they would work fine, 
but those methods completely break encapsulation and scoping
rules! Their use would make an application brittle and hard to maintain.
