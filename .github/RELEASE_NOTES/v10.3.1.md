# Neo.mjs v10.3.1: Build Process Reliability

This is a patch release focused on improving the stability and reliability of the core build process.

## Key Fix: Build Process Dependency Order

### The Problem
The main `buildAll.mjs` script could fail on a clean repository checkout. The build steps that process HTML templates (e.g., `buildESModules`) have a dependency on the `dist/parse5.mjs` bundle. However, the script did not guarantee that this bundle was created before it was needed, leading to a potential crash.

### The Solution
We have updated `buildAll.mjs` to explicitly run the `bundleParse5.mjs` script as one of its first actions, immediately after the optional `npm install`.

### The Impact
This change ensures the `parse5` dependency is always available for subsequent build tasks. It makes the build process more robust and predictable, particularly for developers setting up the project for the first time.
