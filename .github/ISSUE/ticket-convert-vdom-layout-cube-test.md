## Description

This task is to migrate the unit test for `vdom/layout/Cube.mjs` from the Siesta test harness to the Playwright test runner.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Create a new test file at `test/playwright/unit/vdom/layout/Cube.spec.mjs`.
2.  Translate all assertions from the original file (`test/siesta/tests/vdom/layout/Cube.mjs`) to the Playwright/Jest `expect` syntax.
3.  Ensure the new test runs successfully via `npm test`.
4.  The new test must cover all the functionality of the original Siesta test.
