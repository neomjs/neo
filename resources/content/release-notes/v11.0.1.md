# Neo.mjs v11.0.1 Release Notes

This is a stability and bug-fix release that directly follows v11.0.0, ensuring the new AI-native tooling suite is robust and reliable.

The primary focus of this patch is to address a critical bug in the GitHub Workflow MCP server's issue synchronization and archiving logic.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

### GitHub Issue Archiving (#7732)

A significant bug was discovered in the `sync_all` tool that, under certain conditions, could lead to catastrophic misplacement of archived issues. This has been resolved.

-   **The Bug:** On sync runs that used cached data, the `MetadataManager` was not saving the `closedAt` and `updatedAt` fields for issues. This led to `new Date(null)` being used in date comparisons, causing the archiving logic to fail and move issues to incorrect locations.
-   **The Fix:** The `MetadataManager` has been corrected to always save the `closedAt` and `updatedAt` fields to the metadata cache. Additionally, the data flow between the `ReleaseSyncer` and `IssueSyncer` has been optimized to ensure the pre-sorted list of releases is always used, preventing inefficient re-sorting.

With this fix, the issue archiving process is now stable, deterministic, and correct on every run, ensuring the integrity of the local issue database.
