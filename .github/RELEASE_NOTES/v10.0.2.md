**Neo.mjs v10.0.2 Release Notes**

This release includes several enhancements and fixes since v10.0.1.

**Key Updates:**

*   **`README.md` & Comparison Enhancements**: Significant updates to the `README.md`, including a new section "üöÄ Inside v10: A New Era of Frontend Architecture" with links to a five-part blog series. The architectural comparison table "üîç Architectural Deep Dive: Neo.mjs vs. Main-Thread Frameworks" has been expanded, and detailed comparison documents (`NeoVsAngular.md`, `NeoVsReact.md`, `NeoVsVue.md`) have been updated to provide enhanced insights.
*   **Data Model Enhancements**: Default values for `records` now optionally support functions, enabled by changes in `data.RecordFactory`.
*   **DOM Rendering**: `DomApiRenderer` has been improved for creating void attributes, enhancing rendering accuracy.
*   **Core Component Fix**: Re-added the lost `parentId` default value to `component.Abstract`, which resolves an issue with the tooltip singleton.
*   **Dark Theme**: Improved the styling for ghost buttons
*   **Tree List** Polished drag&drop support for the edge case where stores are not using `id` as the keyProperty.
