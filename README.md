## Ready to take the red pill?
Neo.mjs is a modern frontend framework for building high-performant applications running in [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API). We call this kind of applications as **Application Workers** or just App Workers. App Workers in Neo.mjs are designed for complex, large and highly dynamic frontend applications supporting *multi-thread* and *multi-window* features.

## How is Neo different from other Frontend frameworks?
### Development Made Simple 
One design goal of the Neo.mjs project is getting UI development back to where it belongs: the browser.
The dev mode runs without any JavaScript builds or transpilations at all. We don’t need JavaScript source maps and can debug the real code directly in the browser without any external side effects or hot module replacements.

### No Need of Templates
Another important difference with Neo is that instead of creating your components using templates or JSX, you create them with Object Instances. This approach gives us two advantages, first is that we can follow a pattern designed more for User Interfaces rather than documents (sorry HTML) and second, by avoiding to place logic in the template (think of `v-if` in Vue) we improve the performance of rendering components with a huge amount of nodes.

## Tutorials and Documentation
Take a look at the [Documentation](https://neomjs.github.io/pages/node_modules/neo.mjs/docs/index.html) where you can find information about the framework with tutorials and examples on how to create components in Neo.mjs.

## Contribute
As the shiny "PRs welcome" badge suggests: open source is intended to be improved by anyone who is up for the challenge. Don't know where to start? Start by joining our friendly [community on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/neomjs/shared_invite/zt-6c50ueeu-3E1~M4T9xkNnb~M_prEEOA)! 

A nice way to contribute is by writing a guide in case you learned something new while using neo.mjs or helping out to get more eyes on this project.

Read our [Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to find more ways to contribute.

## Sponsors
Consider becoming a [Sponsor](BACKERS.md) of Neo.mjs to accelerate the development of the framework and the future of web development.
