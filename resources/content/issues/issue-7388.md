# Define the "Sighted" Development Workflow

This ticket is for defining the new interactive development workflow that leverages the "sighted" capabilities of the agent. The goal is to create a detailed plan for a continuous loop of development, verification, and testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new markdown document is created in `learn/guides/ai/` that describes the "Sighted" Development Workflow.
2.  The document outlines the step-by-step process of how the agent will:
    a.  Develop a new component.
    b.  Use the MCP server to inspect the DOM and verify changes in real-time.
    c.  Use the insights from the DOM to generate meaningful Playwright tests.
3.  The document serves as a blueprint for implementing the new workflow.
