# Generate LLM.txt File via Build Script

To improve the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand our content, an `llm.txt` file is needed. This file will be automatically generated by a build script to ensure it stays in sync with our content.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Enhance the `buildScripts/generate-seo-files.mjs` script.
2.  Add a function to the script that takes the parsed list of content URLs and formats them into the `llm.txt` syntax (`Allow: /path/to/page`).
3.  The script should write the final output to a new `llm.txt` file in the `apps/portal/` directory.
