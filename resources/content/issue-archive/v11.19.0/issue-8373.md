# Update Introduction.md to highlight Neural Link capabilities

Update `learn/benefits/Introduction.md` to articulate the "Map IS the Territory" concept in the context of the Neural Link.
Key points to cover:
- The distinction between static code (blueprint) and the evolving runtime (building).
- The impact of browser variance and runtime complexity on static analysis.
- How the Neural Link eliminates hallucinations by providing access to the "Ground Truth".
- The capability to solve previously unresolvable runtime-dependent problems.
