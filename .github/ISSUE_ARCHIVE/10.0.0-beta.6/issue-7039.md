# Feature: Add Neo.mjs vs. Vue.js Comparison Article

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-07-13

**Parent Issue:** #7029 - Feature: Add Framework Comparison Articles to Learn Directory

---

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Developers evaluating or learning Neo.mjs often come from other established frameworks, including Vue.js. There is a need for a clear, concise comparison that bridges their existing knowledge to Neo.mjs concepts and highlights Neo.mjs's unique advantages.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a new article within the `learn/comparisons` directory comparing Neo.mjs with Vue.js. The article should:

*   **Bridge Knowledge Gaps:** Explain how concepts familiar from Vue.js (e.g., reactivity system, component structure, lifecycle hooks, Composition API vs. Options API) map to Neo.mjs.
*   **Highlight Differentiators:** Clearly articulate Neo.mjs's unique selling points (e.g., worker-based architecture, fine-grained reactivity, performance, security) in contrast to Vue.js.
*   **Provide Side-by-Side Comparisons:** Use tables or structured sections to compare specific features (component definition, state management, routing, rendering, build process, ecosystem, learning curve).
*   **Discuss Trade-offs:** Acknowledge any trade-offs or scenarios where one framework might be preferred over another.
*   **Suggest Use Cases:** Guide developers on when Neo.mjs might be the optimal choice.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
(None considered, as this is the proposed solution.)

**Additional context**
This article will significantly improve developer onboarding for Vue.js developers, enhance discoverability, and help position Neo.mjs more effectively within the broader web development ecosystem.

**Affected Files (Conceptual):**
*   `learn/comparisons/NeoVsVue.md` (new file)
*   `learn/comparisons/Overview.md` (already updated to include this link)
