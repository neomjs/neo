# Docs: Rebrand Neo.mjs as an Application Engine in README

Reflect the new strategic identity of Neo.mjs as an Application Engine (comparable to Unreal Engine) rather than a traditional UI framework.

**Key Themes to Integrate:**
1.  **Scope:** Neo.mjs is an "Application Engine" (Runtime + Tooling), not just a UI library. (Unreal Engine analogy).
2.  **Performance:** F1 vs Toyota. Purpose-built for speed and precision vs mass-market compromises.
3.  **Structure:** Lego Technic vs Duplo. Engineered parts for complex machinery vs simple blocks for basic shapes.

**Implementation Plan:**
Apply tiny iterations in sequence to `README.md` to ensure no content is lost while shifting the narrative.

## Timeline

- 2026-01-06T11:18:20Z @tobiu added the `enhancement` label
- 2026-01-06T11:18:21Z @tobiu added the `ai` label

### @tobiu - 2026-01-06T11:30:11Z

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have successfully updated the `README.md` to reflect the new "Application Engine" identity, incorporating the "Unreal Engine", "F1 vs Toyota", and "Lego Technic vs Duplo" analogies as requested.
> 
> **Changes applied:**
> 1.  **Header:** "The Application Engine for the AI Era".
> 2.  **Introduction:** Explicit definition as an Engine (Runtime + Tooling) with the Unreal Engine analogy.
> 3.  **Why Choose Neo:** "F1 vs Toyota" analogy for performance.
> 4.  **Batteries Included:** "Lego Technic vs Duplo" analogy for runtime permutation.
> 5.  **Neural Link:** Added as the 5th pillar of the AI-Native platform.
> 6.  **Key Features:** Renamed "Persistent Component Instances" to "Runtime Permutation & Object Permanence".
> 
> The README now clearly articulates the "Engine" vision. I will now proceed to align the `ROADMAP.md` with this new strategic direction in a separate ticket.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have completed the core text rebranding in `README.md`.
> 
> **State of the file:**
> 1.  **Header/Intro:** Defined as "Application Engine" with Unreal Engine analogy.
> 2.  **Why Choose:** F1 vs Toyota analogy integrated.
> 3.  **Batteries:** Lego Technic vs Duplo analogy integrated.
> 4.  **AI-Native:** Neural Link added as the 5th pillar.
> 5.  **Key Features:** "Runtime Permutation & Object Permanence" introduced.
> 
> **Next Steps:**
> The "Architectural Deep Dive" comparison table is now conceptually misaligned (comparing an Engine to Libraries). I will create a follow-up ticket to replace this section with an "Engine Architecture" breakdown (Runtime vs Toolchain vs Assets) instead of patching the existing table.
