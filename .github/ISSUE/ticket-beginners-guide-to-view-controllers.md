## Description

View Controllers are a key architectural concept in Neo.mjs, but we lack beginner-focused content explaining their role.

The goal of this ticket is to write a blog post that introduces View Controllers from a newcomer's perspective.

### Tasks:

1.  Create a new markdown file in the `learn/blog/` directory.
2.  Choose an existing example (e.g., the default app from `npx neo-app`) to use as a reference.
3.  Explain the purpose of a `ViewController` and how it's connected to a view.
4.  Demonstrate how to add a simple event listener within the controller.
5.  Explain the benefits of separating view logic into a controller.
