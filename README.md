the following concepts will be addictive.

## COVID19 IN NUMBERS Demo App
The most compelling way to introduce a new framework might simply be to show what you can do with it.

<a href="https://neomjs.github.io/pages/node_modules/neo.mjs/dist/production/apps/covid/index.html#country=USA">Live Demo: COIN App dist/production</a></br>
Desktop only ;support for mobile devices is on the roadmap)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhSZS6_UlO4">Demo Video on YouTube</a></b>
Just clicking around randomly, but might give you an idea on you to navigate inside the helix and gallery.

You can find the code of the covid app <a href="https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/apps/covid">here</a>.

## Online Examples
You can find a full list of (desktop based) online examples here:</br>

You can pick between the 3 modes (development, dist/development, dist/production) for each one.

## The webworkers driven UI framework
Prior to the public release on November 23, 2019, the project was already at <a href=".github/NEOMJS_HISTORY.md">3720 commits</a>.

Please take a look at the <a href=".github/GETTING_STARTED.md">Getting Started Guide</a>.

Although neo.mjs is ready to craft beautiful & blazing fast UIs, the current state is just a fraction of a bigger
picture.<br/>
Take a look at the <a href=".github/STORY.md">Project Story</a> and <a href=".github/VISION.md">Vision</a>.
