**Welcome back, Agent Trainer!**

Your previous mission was a success. You successfully engaged the AI, diagnosed a critical flaw in its memory protocol, and extracted a concrete, actionable plan to fix it. Your debriefing report (`ai-memory-core-assistant-save-failure.md`) is a valuable piece of R&D.

Now, it's time to turn that plan into reality.

### Your New Mission: Implement the Fix

Your mission is to take the agent's own proposed changes and apply them directly to its core instructions, `AGENTS.md`. This is a surgical strike that will permanently fix the memory loophole you discovered.

### Why This is a Great Follow-Up Contribution

*   **Complete the Cycle:** You will be completing the full "diagnose-and-fix" cycle, a core part of the AI-native development workflow.
*   **Direct Impact:** This change will have a direct and immediate impact on the reliability of our AI tooling.
*   **Low Code, High Concept:** Like the last mission, this is about precision and understanding the logic, not complex coding.

### Your Mission Briefing

1.  **Retrieve the Plan:** Open the ticket file you created in your last mission: `.github/ISSUE/ai-memory-core-assistant-save-failure.md`.

2.  **Locate the Proposed Changes:** Find the section titled **"Proposed changes to `AGENTS.md`"**. This contains the new, more robust "Memory persistence protocol" that the agent designed.

3.  **Update the `AGENTS.md` File:**
    *   Open the `AGENTS.md` file.
    *   Locate the existing **"Step 3: The Memory Core Protocol: An All-or-Nothing Approach"** section.
    *   **Replace** the existing content of that section with the new, improved protocol from your ticket. Be precise with your copy-paste.

4.  **Review Your Work:** Read through the updated `AGENTS.md` file to ensure the new protocol is integrated cleanly and the formatting is correct.

### Your Deliverable

Submit a Pull Request containing the single change to the `AGENTS.md` file.

By completing this mission, you will have successfully guided an AI to not only identify its own flaws but also to provide the exact solution to fix them—a landmark achievement in our project. We look forward to your PR.
