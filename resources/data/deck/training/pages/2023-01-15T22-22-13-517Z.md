The following four labs are elaborate.

They give you 
practice with a common coding task: creating a de-coupled
class with a well-defined API.

Neo has features that makes this easy. Later we'll cover
additional techniques for having a de-coupled class interact
with the rest of an application via events and bindings.

The labs feature common coding use-cases. Take your time &mdash;
make sure everything makes sense!
