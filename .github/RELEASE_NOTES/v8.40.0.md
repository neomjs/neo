# Remotes API polishing

* Some apps & examples already use `remotesApiUrl` inside the `neo-config.json`, but the related files did not get copied into dist envs
* This part happens now (copy for dist dev, minified version for dist prod)
* The API loader will now fetch the right file for a given env
* I did encounter a timing issue inside `apps/colors` for the dist dev env only => adjusted the API access to wait for the namespace registration
