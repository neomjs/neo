# Neo.mjs v11.16.0 Release Notes

**Release Type:** Feature Release  
**Stability:** Production-ready (Neural Link: Experimental Preview)  
**Breaking Changes:** None  
**Upgrade Path:** Drop-in replacement for v11.15.0

**Connecting the Minds: Neural Link & The Cyberpunk Aesthetic**

This release marks a paradigm shift in how Neo.mjs applications interact with the outside world. With the introduction of **Neural Link**, the App Worker is no longer an isolated island—it can now establish direct, bidirectional communication channels with external AI agents.

To match this futuristic capability, we are also shipping **Neo Cyberpunk**, a high-contrast, neon-infused theme designed for the next generation of Agentic Interfaces.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🧠 Neural Link: The 4th MCP Server (Experimental Preview)

**Stability Notice:** Neural Link is an **Early Proof of Concept**. While the core connection architecture is established and verified with E2E tests, the toolset is minimal. Features like full VDOM/VNode tree access, config modification, and blueprint injection are currently in active development. Suitable for architectural exploration only.

We have expanded our AI ecosystem with a fourth Model Context Protocol (MCP) server: **`neo-neural-link`**.

**Why we built this:**
While the standard `chrome-devtools` MCP server is powerful, it is blind to Neo.mjs's multi-threaded architecture. It cannot see inside our **App Worker** (Dedicated or Shared Workers), where the application logic and state actually live.

**Neural Link** bridges this gap. It acts as a dedicated WebSocket gateway (port 8081) into the App Worker, giving Agents direct access to the framework's internals—specifically the JSON-based **VDOM** (next state) and **VNode** (current live state) trees.

*   **Bidirectional Remote Method Access (RMA):** Agents can now *call methods* inside the browser via JSON-RPC 2.0.
*   **The Vision: Self-Evolving Applications:** This infrastructure lays the groundwork for a new paradigm where applications are mutable at runtime.
    *   *Imagine a non-technical user telling an Agent: "Swap the positions of the chart and the grid, and add a summary column to the table."*
    *   Using Neural Link, the Agent can inspect the component tree, modify reactive configurations, or inject new JSON blueprints to reshape the UI instantly—**without a page reload and without touching source code.**
*   **Zero-Config Integration:** Enabled simply by setting `useAiClient: true` in your `neo-config.json`.
*   **Performance:** The `Neo.ai.Client` is dynamically loaded only when enabled, ensuring zero overhead for standard applications.
*   **Standardized Architecture:** Like our other servers, it derives its tool shapes directly from an **OpenAPI specification**, ensuring type safety and predictable behavior for LLMs.

### 🖥️ AgentOS: The "God View"

We continue to refine the **AgentOS Dashboard**, leveraging Neo's multi-window capabilities to create a true command center.

*   **Seamless Drag-to-Popup:** You can now drag dashboard widgets (like the Swarm View) *outside* the main browser window. Crossing the window boundary instantly spawns a new popup window containing the widget, without interrupting the drag operation. This is powered by our enhanced `SortZone` and Shared Worker architecture.
*   **Intervention Panel:** A dedicated interface for human-in-the-loop agent monitoring.
    *   **Buffered Grid:** Replaced the static HTML template with a fully functional `Neo.grid.Container`.
    *   **Data Layer:** Backed by a dedicated `Intervention` model and `Interventions` store, demonstrating proper architecture for real-time logs.
    *   **Custom Renderers:** Features priority-based cell rendering and formatted timestamps.

### 🎨 Neo Cyberpunk Theme

A new visual identity designed for the **AgentOS**. This started as a Proof of Concept for custom app styling but has evolved into a full-fledged framework theme.

*   **From Hack to Architecture:** We moved away from monolithic CSS overrides to a modular, inheritance-based theming architecture. The new theme correctly overrides component variables at the source level (e.g., `resources/scss/theme-cyberpunk/grid/Container.scss`).
*   **Aesthetic:** Deep Space backgrounds (`#0d1117`) with Neon Cyan (`#00d2ff`) and Gold (`#f1c40f`) accents.
*   **Interactivity:** Glowing borders, neon text effects, and wireframe grid layouts.
*   **AgentOS Integration:** The theme includes specific mappings for AgentOS application views (`Viewport.scss`, `InterventionPanel.scss`), connecting application-level semantic variables (like `--agent-accent-strategy`) to the theme's core palette.
*   **Component Support:** Includes custom styling for **Grids** (transparent cells, wireframe look), **Buttons** (Ghost and Secondary variants with neon borders), **Panels**, and **Toolbars**.
*   **Scope & Future:** Currently, the theme covers the components used in AgentOS. We invite the community to request or contribute styles for other widgets as they adopt the theme.

## 🔮 What's Next

**v11.17.0-v11.18.0: The Command Center**

With Neural Link's foundation in place, we're completing the **AgentOS Command Center**—your spatial "God View" for managing AI agent swarms:

*   **Real-time Visualization:** Live graph showing active agents and their current tasks
*   **Thought Stream Windows:** Click any agent to open a multi-window view streaming its cognitive process from the Memory Core
*   **Plan Approval Workflows:** Human-in-the-loop controls for strategic agent decisions

**Looking Ahead:** Runtime UI modification (Phase 4) remains in active research. The Neural Link API is currently in **Proof of Concept (PoC)** status. Interested in the architecture? Feel free to reach out on GitHub or Discord.
