# Add Maturity Statement to README Qualification Section

Add a sub-headline to the "Is Neo.mjs Right for You?" section in `README.md` to explicitly state the platform's maturity and scale.

**Addition:**
"*It is a mature, enterprise-grade platform with over 130,000 lines of production-ready code.*"

**Goal:** Provide immediate credibility about the project's stability and size alongside the positioning statement.
