## Bug Fixes

### table.Body
- Fixed a JavaScript error that occurred when filtering a table's store. The `onStoreFilter()` method calls `onStoreLoad()` without passing the required `data` argument, leading to an error. This has been resolved by adjusting the method signature of `onStoreLoad()` to handle the missing argument gracefully.
