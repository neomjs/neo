# Clarify Agent Workflow Transition

To prevent future process errors, a clarification will be added to the `AGENTS.md` file. This change addresses a specific failure pattern where a conceptual discussion that transitions into an actionable file modification request was not being preceded by a new ticket.

## Goal

Add a note to the "Actionable/Modification" section of the Development Workflow in `AGENTS.md`. This note will explicitly state that when a conversation shifts from brainstorming ("what if we...") to implementation ("let's do..."), it must be treated as a new actionable request that requires a ticket before any modifications are made.
