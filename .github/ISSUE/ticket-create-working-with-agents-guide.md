# Ticket: Create "Working with AI Agents" Guide

**Assignee:** Gemini
**Status:** In Progress

## Description

Create a new guide, `WORKING_WITH_AGENTS.md`, to provide instructions for human developers on how to effectively interact with AI agents within this repository.

This guide should cover two primary topics:
1.  **Session Initiation:** How to start a session by instructing the agent to follow the rules in `AGENTS.md`.
2.  **Error Recovery:** How to guide an agent to recover from mistakes, such as typos or getting stuck, by asking it to review its own actions.
