# Feature: Add Neo.mjs vs. Solid.js Comparison Article

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Developers evaluating or learning Neo.mjs often come from other established frameworks, including Solid.js, which also emphasizes fine-grained reactivity. There is a need for a clear, concise comparison that bridges their existing knowledge to Neo.mjs concepts and highlights Neo.mjs's unique advantages.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a new article within the `learn/comparisons` directory comparing Neo.mjs with Solid.js. The article should:

*   **Bridge Knowledge Gaps:** Explain how concepts familiar from Solid.js (e.g., signals, component execution model) map to Neo.mjs.
*   **Highlight Differentiators:** Clearly articulate Neo.mjs's unique selling points (e.g., worker-based architecture, VDOM approach, batching/aggregation) in contrast to Solid.js.
*   **Provide Side-by-Side Analysis:** Use structured sections to compare key aspects like rendering mechanism, component execution model, overall architecture, and update aggregation/batching.
*   **Discuss Trade-offs:** Acknowledge any trade-offs or scenarios where one framework might be preferred over another.
*   **Suggest Use Cases:** Guide developers on when Neo.mjs might be the optimal choice.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
(None considered, as this is the proposed solution.)

**Additional context**
This article will significantly improve developer onboarding for Solid.js developers, enhance discoverability, and help position Neo.mjs more effectively within the broader web development ecosystem.

**Affected Files:**
*   `learn/comparisons/NeoVsSolid.md` (new file)
*   `learn/comparisons/Overview.md` (already updated to include this link)
