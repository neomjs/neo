# Rename DevIndex Spider Guides to Data Factory

- Rename `learn/guides/devindex/spider` directory to `learn/guides/devindex/data-factory`.
- Update all internal paths in the moved `.md` files (if any links exist).
- Update `learn/guides/devindex/tree.json` to reflect the new `Data Factory` parent node and updated paths.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have completed the rename operation. The `spider` directory is now `data-factory`, and `tree.json` has been updated to reflect the new parent node name ("The Data Factory") and the updated paths. Checked for internal links needing updates, none found. Changes pushed. Closing issue.
