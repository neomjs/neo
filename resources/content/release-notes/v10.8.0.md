# Neo.mjs v10.8.0 Release Notes

## Summary

Version 10.8.0 is a significant minor release focused on enhancing the AI-Native development experience. This version formalizes a more advanced, query-driven documentation strategy and introduces a new blog post detailing the philosophy and architecture behind Neo.mjs's AI-first approach.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Refined AI Agent Workflow & Query Tool

The AI agent guidelines (`AGENTS.md`) and the underlying query engine have been significantly enhanced to improve the entire AI-native development workflow.

-   **Advanced Query Filtering:** The knowledge base query script (`queryKnowledgeBase.mjs`) was refactored to use `commander` and now includes a powerful `--type` flag. This allows developers and AI agents to filter search results by content type (`all`, `blog`, `guide`, `src`, `example`), making it much easier to find specific kinds of information.
-   **Query-Driven Documentation:** The agent protocol was updated with the "Contributing Queryable, Intent-Driven Comments" strategy. This requires agents to enrich source code with conceptual keywords, `@summary` tags, and `@see` links, turning our codebase into a more discoverable knowledge base.
-   **Structural Improvements:** The `AGENTS.md` document flow was improved by relocating key sections and fixing cross-references for better readability.
-   **Regression Testing:** The agent guidelines now include a prompt to create regression tests for all bug fixes, with a direct link to the `UnitTestingWithSiesta.md` guide to ensure issues, once solved, stay solved.

This change transforms the AI from a simple code generator into a true contributor to the project's long-term health and maintainability.

### 2. Enhanced StateProvider Example

As the first implementation of our new documentation strategy, the advanced StateProvider example (`examples/stateProvider/advanced/`) has been updated with comprehensive, intent-driven JSDoc comments. This makes the example a much clearer, self-documenting resource for understanding hierarchical state management in Neo.mjs.

### 3. New Blog Post: "AI-Native, Not AI-Assisted"

A new in-depth article has been added to our blog, which covers:

-   The core philosophy behind building an AI-Native framework.
-   A technical deep-dive into our local-first, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
-   A comparison of Neo.mjs's approach with other industry implementations like Angular's MCP.
-   The future roadmap for extending these AI capabilities to user-created workspaces.
