# Integrate GitHub Workflow server tests into Playwright suite

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-11-01

PR #7678 introduced two new testing files (`openapi-issues.test.mjs` and `tool-registration.test.mjs`) for the `github-workflow` MCP server. This ticket is to integrate these new server-side tests into our existing Playwright testing suite, ensuring consistency and maintainability of our test infrastructure.
