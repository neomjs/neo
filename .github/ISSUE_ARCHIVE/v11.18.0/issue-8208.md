# ai.client.ComponentService: Make highlightComponent non-blocking

Refactor `Neo.ai.client.ComponentService` => `highlightComponent` to return immediately.

**Current Behavior:**
The method awaits the `duration` (default 2000ms) before returning. This blocks the AI agent from performing subsequent actions (like highlighting another component) until the previous highlight expires.

**Desired Behavior:**
- Apply the highlight style immediately.
- Schedule the style removal (cleanup) using `this.timeout()` or `setTimeout`.
- Return `{success: true}` **immediately**, without waiting for the cleanup.
- Ensure the cleanup runs in the background.

**Goal:**
Allow high-frequency highlighting operations without artificial delays.

**Input from Gemini:**

> ✦ I have refactored `highlightComponent` to be non-blocking. 
> 
> **Changes:**
> - Removed `async/await`.
> - The method now applies the style and returns `{success: true}` immediately.
> - The style removal is handled by a background `this.timeout(duration).then(...)` chain, ensuring the cleanup happens without delaying the response to the agent.
