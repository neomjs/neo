# Create DevIndex Guide: Policy Makers & Gov Funding

**Objective:** Expand on the "Macro-Economic Analysis" to target policymakers looking to fund digital infrastructure.
**Key Points:**
- Provide a guide on how to filter by country to visualize the disparity between open-source consumption and production.
- Provide hard, empirical data comparing outputs across regions (US, UK, Germany, India, China).
- Use this data to justify the need for national and institutional FOSS infrastructure funding, demonstrating the massive unpaid labor currently driving the global software economy.
