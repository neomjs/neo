As we discussed before, any time you configure a class via a config
you're free to create a class encapsulating the config properties.

In other words, any time you have an `ntype` or `module` block, 
you're free to create a new class that extends that type, and
move the config to the new class `static getConfig` mehtod.

Trivial classes might be done inline. Or to keep the view cleaner, 
and more declarative, use a separate view model class.
