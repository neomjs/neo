Those labs were lengthy because we worked _very_ slowly and methodically.

On a project, encapsulating code like this isn't usually needed. You code
views that show data, and you nest those in containers.

But if you need a propertly encapsulated class you'll do something like you
did with the `Yelp.view.businesses.Filter`. 

But there isn't much code in there! 

- It has a property
- Updates to the properties are reflected in the view
- Updates to the view are reflected in the properies

After you code a couple of such classes it becomes a matter of minutes
to code them.
