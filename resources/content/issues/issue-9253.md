# Add Neo Funding Case Study to Introduction Guide

We need to add a "Case Study: The DevIndex Itself" subsection to the `Introduction.md` guide.

This section should provide a real-world, empirical example of the macro-economic FOSS funding gaps discussed earlier in the document, using the DevIndex project as the primary case study.

Tasks:
- Update `learn/guides/devindex/Introduction.md`.
- Add a new subsection under "Data Science Use Cases & The Policy Story".
- Highlight that Neo.mjs has been in development for 7 years (GA in Nov 2019) with zero private or government sponsorship.
- Emphasize the extraordinary velocity enabled by the AI tooling (nearly 400 resolved tickets in a single month, encompassing the DevIndex, the Grid Rewrite, and the Stream Proxy).
- Frame this not as a complaint, but as a sobering proof-point of the "Invisibility Problem" and the lack of structural FOSS funding for foundational architecture.
