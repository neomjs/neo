# Neo.mjs v11.14.0 Release Notes

**The Genesis of the Autonomous Agent.**

The Neo.mjs AI ecosystem has evolved rapidly. We began with the **Code Execution Pattern** ("Thick Client"), enabling agents to write and execute scripts that directly imported our internal services (`ai/services.mjs`). This pattern remains highly valuable for high-performance tool composition and "Logic near Data" operations.

With v11.14.0, we are accelerating our roadmap. We have pulled forward the formal **`Neo.ai.Agent`** class (originally targeted for v12.0) to establish the foundation for **Phase 4: The Neural Link**.

This release transitions the framework from a collection of powerful tools into a true **Agent Operating System**. Agents are no longer just ad-hoc scripts; they are now first-class citizens with a standardized lifecycle, a cognitive runtime, and the ability to connect to the wider world via the Model Context Protocol. This empowerment paves the way for our long-term vision: a **Swarm** of autonomous agents capable of spawning, coordinating, and composing tools dynamically.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🧠 The Birth of Neo.ai.Agent & The Cognitive Runtime

We have formalized the agent into a robust class structure. The new `Neo.ai.Agent` is an autonomous daemon powered by a sophisticated **Cognitive Loop**:

1.  **Perceive:** Events (User prompts, System errors, Telemetry) enter a new `PriorityQueue`.
2.  **Reason:** The Agent constructs a context-aware prompt using the new `ContextAssembler`.
3.  **Act:** The Agent executes tools or RPC calls.
4.  **Reflect:** A new `reflect()` phase evaluates the outcome of every action, allowing the agent to self-correct and store successful patterns in its long-term memory.

This architecture creates a "Level 3 Autonomy" baseline, enabling agents to operate as persistent background services that monitor and maintain applications without constant human prompting.

### 🧩 Expanding Horizons: MCP Client SDK

While the "Code Execution Pattern" excels at internal, high-speed operations, our agents needed a standard way to talk to the rest of the world.

We have introduced the **MCP Client SDK** (`Neo.ai.mcp.Client`), powered by the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. This allows Neo.mjs agents to connect to *any* standard MCP server—whether it's our own `github-workflow`, a third-party PostgreSQL connector, or a remote file system.
*   **Internal Power:** Direct imports (`ai/services.mjs`) for speed and composition.
*   **External Reach:** MCP Clients (`agent.connect('my-db-server')`) for ecosystem integration.

This hybrid approach gives agents the best of both worlds: the raw power to compose internal tools and the flexibility to interact with external systems.

### 🖥️ Agent OS: Realizing "The Command Center"

Fulfilling **Phase 3** of our roadmap, we have scaffolded the **Agent OS** (`apps/agent-os`), a specialized multi-window application designed to visualize and control the swarm.
*   **Multi-Window Architecture:** Separation of concerns with a "Strategy Window" for high-level planning and a "Swarm Window" for real-time intervention.
*   **Blackboard Visualization:** A new Canvas-based graph visualization (PoC) that renders the state of the agent swarm (Issues/Tasks) in real-time, running on a dedicated worker for maximum performance.

### 🏭 The Feature Factory Experiment

This release also contains the artifacts of our "Feature Factory" experiment—standalone "Headless" agents (`pm.mjs` and `dev.mjs`) that successfully demonstrated the ability to autonomously break down Epics into Tickets and convert Tickets into Pull Requests using the new `PROTOCOL.md` standards.
