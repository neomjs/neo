# grid.column.Component: recordProperty config

Components can delegate event listeners (or button handlers) into methods somewhere inside
the view controller or component tree hierarchy.

In this case, it is helpful to know what the related record is, so we are adding the record
to the component as a property. By default, as 'record', but this config can change the property name.
