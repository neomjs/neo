# Rewrite TICKET_STRATEGY.md for GitHub Workflow MCP Server & 2-Way Sync

## Task
The `TICKET_STRATEGY.md` document needs a comprehensive rewrite to align with the new `github-workflow` MCP server and its 2-way synchronization capabilities. This rewrite should clearly define the updated workflow for managing tasks, features, and bug fixes, incorporating the new tooling.

## Scope
1.  The `TICKET_STRATEGY.md` document is fully rewritten to reflect the current state of the `github-workflow` MCP server and its 2-way sync features.
2.  The document clearly outlines the process for creating, associating, and archiving tickets, emphasizing the use of dedicated tools where applicable.
3.  The archival process is re-introduced and described in terms of its automated execution (e.g., `sync_all` on startup), rather than manual agent steps.
4.  The document provides high-level guidance for both human and AI contributors on how to interact with the new ticket management system, focusing on tool usage rather than intricate manual procedures for agents.

## Goal
To provide clear, up-to-date documentation for the project's ticket management strategy, fully leveraging the capabilities of the `github-workflow` MCP server and supporting both human and AI contributors.
