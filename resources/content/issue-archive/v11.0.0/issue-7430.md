# Update and Formalize Project VISION.md

This ticket documents the collaborative effort to update and formalize the project's `VISION.md` file. The previous content was outdated and no longer reflected the project's current strategic direction.

The new `VISION.md` articulates a forward-looking vision for Neo.mjs as the definitive platform for next-generation web applications, democratizing development and leveraging AI as a collaborative partner.

Key aspects of the updated vision include:

1.  **Three Core Pillars:** The vision is structured around:
    *   **Performance by Architecture:** Emphasizing off-main-thread (OMT) architecture for invisible, solved performance.
    *   **Productivity by Design:** Highlighting a unified config system, zero-builds workflow, and a cohesive ecosystem of tools, including optional server-side middleware and deep browser integrations.
    *   **Democratizing Expertise through AI Partnership:** Focusing on Context Engineering and AI as a co-developer, with the end game of AI as a proactive senior partner.
2.  **Democratization Theme:** The vision emphasizes making elite performance and architectural patterns accessible to all developers.
3.  **"End Game" Perspective:** It paints a picture of the future experience, where performance is invisible, creation is effortless, and AI is a proactive co-developer.
4.  **Sustainability:** It includes a section on "Building a Sustainable Future" to ensure the project's long-term health and innovation.
