/**
 * The e2e tier's coverage summary is an honesty guard: `testIgnore` DESELECTS the Brain-dependent
 * specs rather than skipping them, so no reporter can name them and a run missing four fifths of
 * the tier still prints `Skipped: 0`. This summary is the only artifact that says what a green
 * check actually certifies.
 *
 * Which makes its arithmetic load-bearing rather than cosmetic. It shipped stating that
 * `${ignored + gpu}` files were excluded — a sum of two named classes that omitted a third — so the
 * sentence reported 89 while its own header two paragraphs above said 14 of 105. A guard whose one
 * job is accurate counting, contradicting itself in the paragraph a reader trusts most.
 *
 * The arms below assert the numbers RECONCILE rather than pinning any of them. A pinned `14` passes
 * today and rots on the next spec added, which is the failure mode a coverage guard can least
 * afford: it would go on being green while describing a tier that had moved.
