## Neo.mjs v10.0.0-beta.4 Release Notes

This beta release introduces a powerful, opt-in **Reactive Config System**, a foundational architectural enhancement that enables fine-grained, cross-instance state management and significantly improves the developer experience for building complex, interactive applications.

### Core Framework & Features

The centerpiece of this release is the new reactive config system, internally named "Config Atoms". This system is fully opt-in and backward compatible, ensuring that existing applications continue to work without any changes.

*   **New Reactive Config System ("Config Atoms")**:
    *   **Opt-in Reactivity**: By adding a trailing underscore (`_`) to a config property in its `static config` block (e.g., `myValue_`), the property becomes "reactive." It is automatically wrapped in a `Neo.core.Config` instance, which acts as an observable container for its value.
    *   **Cross-Instance State Sharing**: The new system exposes a `subscribe()` method on each reactive config, allowing components to listen for changes to a config on any other component instance. This enables a clean, decoupled, and highly efficient way to implement cross-component state synchronization.
        ```javascript
        // In ComponentA
        const componentB = Neo.get('b');

        // Subscribe to changes in componentB's 'items' config
        this.cleanup = componentB.getConfig('items').subscribe((newValue, oldValue) => {
            this.someOtherProperty = newValue; // Reactively update
        });

        // In ComponentA's destroy() method:
        this.cleanup?.(); // Simple, clean, and prevents memory leaks.
        ```
    *   **Fine-Grained Control (Future Foundation)**: While not fully implemented in this beta, the groundwork is laid for using config descriptors to define custom `mergeStrategy` and `isEqual` functions, which will provide even more control over config behavior in a future release.
    *   **Transactional Consistency**: The new system fully integrates with Neo.mjs's existing transactional update mechanism (`set()`), ensuring that `afterSet` hooks always have a consistent view of all pending config changes within a single operation.

### Developer Experience

*   **Simplified State Management**: The `subscribe()` API drastically simplifies the logic required for components to react to state changes in other parts of the application, reducing boilerplate and the need for complex event chains.
*   **Improved Debugging**: The observable nature of reactive configs makes it easier to trace how and when state changes occur throughout your application.

This release marks a significant step forward in the evolution of the Neo.mjs architecture. The new reactive config system provides a robust foundation for building the next generation of highly interactive and state-driven web applications.

### Call To Action

We are incredibly excited for you to start experimenting with this powerful new feature!

*   **Try Reactive Configs**: Start by making a config reactive by adding a `_` to its name in the `static config` block and explore the new possibilities with `getConfig().subscribe()`.
*   **Share Your Feedback**: This is a foundational change, and your feedback is more critical than ever.
