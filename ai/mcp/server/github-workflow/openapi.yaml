  title: Neo.mjs GitHub Workflow MCP Server API
  description: |
    This API provides structured access to the Neo.mjs GitHub repository, enabling the automation of contribution workflows. 
    It uses a hybrid approach, leveraging both the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for simple, direct commands (e.g., checking out a PR) 
    and the GitHub GraphQL API for complex data fetching and mutations (e.g., listing PRs, creating comments, syncing issues).
    This allows AI agents to programmatically interact with pull requests and issues in a safe and efficient manner.

        Verifies that the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed, authenticated, and meets the minimum version requirement.

        **When to Use:**
        This should be the first tool you run if you suspect any issues with the GitHub Workflow MCP server. It provides a quick diagnostic check on the server's primary dependency.

        **When to Use:**
        This is a crucial discovery tool. Call it before using `create_issue` or `manage_issue_labels` to ensure you are using valid, existing label names.

        Retrieves a list of pull requests from the GitHub repository.

        **When to Use:**
        - To get a high-level overview of pending work (using the default `state: 'open'`).
        - To research historical context by looking at past work (e.g., using `state: 'closed'` or `state: 'merged'`).
        - To find a specific pull request number for use in other tools.
        - When the user asks questions like:
          - "What pull requests are currently open?"
          - "Show me recently merged PRs."

        **Best Practices:**
        - After calling this tool, summarize the list of PRs for the user.
        - Highlight key details such as the PR number, title, author, and state.
        - Avoid showing the raw JSON output to the user unless they explicitly ask for it.

        **Future Enhancements:**
        Note that a future feature will sync PR conversations to local markdown files, providing a more detailed way to review historical PRs. For now, this tool is the primary way to browse PR history.

      description: |
        Checks out the branch for a given pull request locally using `gh pr checkout`.
        This modifies the local filesystem to reflect the state of the pull request branch.

        **When to Use:**
        Use this tool when you need to locally inspect the code changes of a pull request, run tests, or perform a more detailed review.

        **Workflow:**
        1. **Ensure your current work is committed or stashed.** Before switching branches, make sure you save your current work to prevent losing changes (e.g., using `git stash`).
        2. **Check out the pull request branch** using this tool.
        3. **Review and test the code locally.**
        4. **Return to your previous branch** when you are done (e.g., using `git checkout -`).

        **Safety Note:** Always commit or stash your changes before checking out a new branch to avoid losing work.

        Retrieves the full markdown content of a local issue file by its number, searching both active and archived issues.

        **When to Use:**
        Use this tool for a fast, offline-capable way to read the content of an issue that is already present on the local disk. This tool reads directly from the file system and does **not** access the GitHub API.

        **Important:** The content returned reflects the state of the issue at the time of the last `sync_all` operation and may not be the most up-to-date version if remote changes have occurred since.

        Creates a new issue on GitHub. This is the authoritative first step for creating a new ticket.

        ## CRITICAL PROTOCOL: READ BEFORE USING
        You generally FAIL to show the proposal to the user before calling this tool. Do not let that happen.

        **MANDATORY WORKFLOW (Do Not Skip):**

        1.  **Check Labels:** Run `list_labels` to verify available labels.
        2.  **Draft Content:** Formulate the `title`, `body`, and `labels`.
        3.  **VISUAL PROPOSAL (REQUIRED):** You **MUST** display the proposed ticket content to the user **IN THE CHAT** before calling this tool. Use this format:
            ```text
            Title: [Proposed Title]
            Labels: [label1, label2]
            Body:
            [Proposed Body]
            ```
        4.  **Call Tool:** Immediately call `create_issue` after displaying the proposal. Do not ask for permission first (the user can decline the tool call).

        **STRICT LABELING RULES:**
        - **MANDATORY:** The `ai` label is REQUIRED on ALL tickets you create.
        - **PRIMARY:** Include one primary label: `epic`, `enhancement`, or `bug`.
        - **SECONDARY:** Add other relevant labels (e.g., `documentation`) if they exist.

        **Post-Creation:**
        The tool returns the new issue number. You can use this number immediately for other tools (e.g., `create_comment`, `manage_issue_assignees`).
        To update the issue body later, use `run_shell_command` with `gh issue edit {number} --body "..."`.

      description: |
        Manages relationships between GitHub issues including parent-child hierarchies and blocked-by dependencies.
        This tool allows you to set or unset relationships between issues on GitHub.

        **Relationship Types:**
        - **parent_child**: Creates hierarchical relationships (epics with sub-tasks)
        - **blocked_by**: Creates dependency relationships (issue A is blocked by issue B)

        **When to Use:**
        - To organize work by creating issue hierarchies (epics with sub-tasks)
        - To track dependencies where one issue blocks another
        - To unlink issues from their relationships
        - To move a child issue from one parent to another

        **Important Notes:**
        - Changes are made directly on GitHub via the GraphQL API
        - The local markdown files will be updated on the next `sync_all` operation
        - For parent_child: An issue can only have ONE parent at a time
        - For blocked_by: An issue can be blocked by MULTIPLE issues
        - Use `replace_parent=true` to replace an existing parent relationship (parent_child only)
        - To remove relationships, call with only `child_issue` specified (omit `parent_issue`)

        **Workflow:**
        1. Identify the issue numbers and relationship type
        2. Call this tool to establish or modify the relationship
        3. Run `sync_all` to update local markdown files with the new relationship

        Triggers the full, bi-directional synchronization of GitHub issues and releases with the local filesystem.

        **When to Use (Use Sparingly):**
        - **Fetching Remote Changes:** Call this if you suspect a teammate has updated tickets and you need to see the changes locally.
        - **Pushing Local Edits:** Call this if you have manually modified a local `.md` file (e.g., updating a description) and need to push that text change to GitHub.

        **When NOT to Use:**
        - **Do NOT call after `create_issue` or `create_comment`:** You already have the content in your context window. The server also handles basic sync automatically.
        - **Do NOT call for code changes:** This tool only syncs ticket metadata, not code commits.

        **Key Functions:**
        - **Pulls remote changes:** Fetches the latest issue and release data from GitHub.
        - **Creates local files:** If a new issue was created on GitHub (e.g., via the `create_issue` tool), this process will create the corresponding local `.md` file.
        - **Pushes local changes:** Scans for modifications in local issue files (in the active `ISSUE` directory only) and pushes them to GitHub.
        - **Efficient:** Uses a metadata cache and content hashing to ensure that only actual changes are pushed or pulled, making it fast for no-op runs.
