# Create DevIndex Guide: The Ethical Manifesto (Why We Built This)

**Objective:** Address the "ripping data" concern head-on by clearly stating the project's ethical foundation and mission.
**Key Points:**
- Define the "Invisibility Problem" in open-source.
- Address the attribution failure of modern LLMs that ingest FOSS data without giving credit back to the developers.
- Explain why enforcing a strict, 50,000-user meritocracy is vital for the sustainability of open-source.
- Reiterate that DevIndex is a non-commercial, tracking-free, ad-free project with a strict Opt-Out-first privacy policy.

**Input from Gemini 3.1 Pro:**

> ✦ **Note for future agent session:** 
> Before starting work on this guide, you **MUST** read the following existing documentation as critical context:
> - `learn/guides/devindex/Introduction.md` (For the framing of the LLM attribution failure and the Invisibility Problem)
> - `learn/guides/devindex/OptOut.md` & `learn/guides/devindex/OptIn.md` (To provide technical, cryptographic proof that we enforce the privacy and meritocracy we preach)
