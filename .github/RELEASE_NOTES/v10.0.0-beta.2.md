## Neo.mjs v10.0.0-beta.2 Release Notes

This beta release brings significant enhancements across documentation, core framework capabilities, and **a major focus on improving component rendering performance and security**, alongside an enhanced developer experience.

### Documentation & Learning Content

We've made substantial updates to the `learn` section to provide clearer, more comprehensive guidance:

*   **Enhanced Benefits Guides**:
*   **Forms Engine**: Improved introduction, detailed benefits, and business value connections for state management, unmounted
*   validation, and nested/lazy-loaded forms.
*   **Multi-Window Applications**: Expanded use cases and clearer explanations of seamless data/state sharing.
*   **Quick Application Development**: Detailed how property lifecycle hooks, elegant state management, and powerful debugging
*   contribute to rapid development.
*   **Effort vs. Complexity**: Refined explanation of Neo.mjs's linear scaling of effort with complexity, including the initial learning curve.
*   **Speed**: Improved introduction highlighting web worker benefits for performance.
*   **Features Summary**: Updated with direct links to detailed benefit guides for easier navigation.
*   **New RPC Layer Guide**: A dedicated guide (`learn/benefits/RPCLayer.md`) explaining the RPC layer's role in seamless
*   communication across Web Workers, Main Threads, and backend services, including practical examples.
*   **Updated Glossary**: The `learn/Glossary.md` has been significantly expanded and polished
*   **Instance Lifecycle Guide**: New comprehensive guide (`learn/guides/InstanceLifecycle.md`) detailing the synchronous and
    asynchronous phases of component creation and destruction, including `constructor()` vs. `construct()` and `isReady` concepts.
*   **Main Thread Addons Guide**: Enhanced with visualizations for remote method access and explanations of `interceptRemotes` for
    automatic method caching.
*   **Learning Path Refinements**: The `learn/tree.json` structure has been reordered to provide a more logical learning progression for
    guides.
*   **Code Block Improvements**: Various formatting and rendering fixes for code blocks across documentation.

### Core Framework & Features

*   **Remote Method Interception for Addons**: `addon.Base` now intercepts remote calls that arrive before an addon is fully
    `isReady`, enabling more robust asynchronous initialization for addon methods.
*   **New Class Hierarchy Manager**: Introduction of `manager.ClassHierarchy` (`#6876`), a new core manager that provides robust
    class hierarchy information, including memoized `isA()` queries and integration into `Neo.Main` and other workers.

### Rendering & Components

*   **Enhanced VDom Security & Performance (DomApiRenderer Integration)**: A major internal refactoring has been completed to
    replace `html` with `text` on VDom node properties across
    hundreds of components (`app/*`, `Neo.*`, `component.*`, `form.field.FileUpload`, `Neo.calendar.view.*`, `Portal.view.*`). This
    significant change leverages the `DomApiRenderer` introduced in v10 to:
    *   **Improve Security**: By defaulting to `text` content, Neo.mjs now inherently prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
        by escaping HTML, making applications more secure by design.
    *   **Boost Performance**: Direct text manipulation is generally more performant than parsing and injecting HTML, leading to faster
        and more efficient DOM updates.
    *   **`component.Base` `text_` Config**: Added a new `text_` config to `component.Base` for direct text content management.
    *   **Grid/Table Rendering**: `grid.Body` and `table.Body` now support the `text` property in `applyRendererOutput()`, offering an
        alternative to `html` for rendering.

### Internal Improvements & Refactoring

*   **`main.DeltaUpdates` Enhanced Initialization**: The `main.DeltaUpdates` module now utilizes `initAsync()`, a significant
    improvement for its initialization process, alongside updated JSDoc comments.
*   Minor code cleanups and method reordering in `vdom.Helper`.
*   Minor fixes in `component.MagicMoveText` and `Portal.view.learn.ContentComponent`.
