# Code Quality Refinement

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-07-31

---

**Parent Issue:** #7130 - String-Based VDOM Templates

---

**Description:**
After the feature is functionally complete and well-tested, refactor the new modules (`HtmlTemplateProcessor`, etc.) to meet the high code quality standards of the neo.mjs framework. This includes adding comprehensive JSDoc comments, ensuring adherence to coding guidelines, and optimizing for clarity and performance.
