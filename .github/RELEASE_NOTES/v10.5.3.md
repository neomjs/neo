# Neo.mjs v10.5.3 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

- **grid.Container**: Corrected the calculation for the `aria-rowcount` attribute. The count was previously `store.count + 2`, and has been adjusted to `store.count + 1` to accurately reflect the number of data rows plus the single header row, improving accessibility for screen readers.
