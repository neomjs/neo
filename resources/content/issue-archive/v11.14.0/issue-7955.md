# Feat: Implement Agent OS Multi-Window Layout

Implement the initial multi-window layout for the Agent OS Command Center.
- Primary Window: Strategy View (Main)
- Secondary Window: Swarm/Intervention View
- Ensure the application supports managing multiple windows.
- Refactor `apps/agent-os/view/Viewport.mjs` to implement this layout.
