Neo takes the _declarative_ approach, 
where you configure high-level components. The details of rendering
those to the run-time environment is handled by the framework (and 
low-level code).

Ultimately, components do need to translate into DOM and styling, and
you may need to do that yourself occastionally, but
Neo tries to make that the exception, rather than the rule.
