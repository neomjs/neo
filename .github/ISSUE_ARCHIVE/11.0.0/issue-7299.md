# Add Intent-Driven JSDoc to Tab Container Example

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-09-28

---

**Parent Issue:** #7296 - Hacktoberfest 2025: Build Your AI Development Skills with Neo.mjs

---

The example file at `examples/tab/container/MainContainer.mjs` has JSDoc comments, but they are missing context. They list parameters but don't explain the *purpose* or *intent* of the methods.

The goal of this ticket is to enhance the existing JSDoc to meet our "intent-driven" standard.

### Tasks:

1.  Open the file `examples/tab/container/MainContainer.mjs`.
2.  For each method, add a concise summary sentence above the `@param` tags explaining what the method does.
3.  Use `src/core/Base.mjs` as a reference for high-quality, intent-driven JSDoc style.
