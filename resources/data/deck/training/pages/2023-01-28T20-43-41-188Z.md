Neo implements Tables as a `Neo.table.header.Toolbar` followed by a `Neo.table.View`.

You don't reference these directly &mdash; they are created automatically using
the configs you provide for the table.

If needed, you can provide header configs via `headerToolbarConfig`


And you can provide view configuration via `viewConfig`.
