# Ticket: Create v10 Top-Level Blog Post

## 1. Goal
Create the main "hub" blog post for the v10 release. This post should be a high-level, compelling summary of the new features and their benefits.

## 2. Target Audience
All web developers, including those from other framework ecosystems (React, Vue, etc.). The tone should be exciting and accessible.

## 3. Key Talking Points
- **Title Idea:** *Neo.mjs v10: A Revolution in Reactivity and Performance*
- **Narrative:** Frame v10 as a next-generation framework that elegantly solves common web development challenges.
- **Sections:**
    - The "Hook": The power of multi-threading.
    - Modern Functional Components (relatable entry point).
    - Effortless State Management ("Two-Tier Reactivity").
    - Surgical DOM Updates (performance).
    - Secure by Design (XSS protection).
- **Call to Action:** Encourage readers to try the examples and read the deep-dive articles.

## 4. Deliverable
A complete draft of the blog post as a markdown file.
