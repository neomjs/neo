# Sponsors & Backers

Truth to be told, the neo.mjs project is in need of sponsors & backers.

As an <a href="./LICENSE">MIT-licensed</a> open source project,
you can use neo.mjs for free (as long as you stick to the license & copyright notice).

Prior to the public release, the project was already at <a href=".github/NEOMJS_HISTORY.md">3720 commits</a>.

To get neo.mjs to this point, I spent 1.5 years of my full and unpaid working time.
This does not only include a big amount of 100h+ weeks and several sleepless nights,
but I also burned most of my personal savings to get here.

I did this, since I truly and deeply believe that neo.mjs has the potential to start a new era of UI development.

The current version is just a fraction of a much bigger picture I have in mind.
Trust me, it is beautiful :)

I can definitely say that I did use several other UI frameworks in the past and that neo.mjs boosted my productivity
to an entire new level.

This is something I would love to share with you!

## Special Offer
The first 4 Bronze, and the first 4 Silver tier sponsors will get kept on the main Readme file for an additional year,
after the day the 4th sponsor does sign up (*).
By default, the main Readme will only include sponsors starting at the Gold tier.

(*) You will get removed from the main Readme file, in case you end the sponsorship prior to the end of
the time interval.

# What will I sponsor?
Obviously the continuing of the development for the neo.mjs framework.
To get the idea of what this means in detail, please take a look at the: <a href=".github/VISION.md">Project Vision</a>.

# Why should I sponsor neo.mjs?
I am in need to make up for the invested time, which means that going forward,
I have to spend a lot of my time on billable projects.
Of course I will do my best to continue pushing neo.mjs in my free time.

With active sponsors I could invest more time into neo.mjs,
which means that you will get new features, guides and bug-fixes a lot faster.

# For developers:
You could select a Backer tier ($10 / month), which would equal a cup of coffee for me every month (after taxes).
This will not cover my living costs (unless neo.mjs goes viral), but it does have an impact on
my motivation for sure.

# For companies:
Starting at the bronze tier, you will be able to place your company logo on the main repository landing page (Readme.md).
Especially in the early days, this will have a high impact on the neo.mjs community and make it easier for you
to find neo.mjs developers in the future.

Obviously, sponsoring open source projects in general will increase your companies reputation.

As soon as the neo.mjs community grows, it will also increase your company visibility in a good way.

Please make sure to create a feature request ticket inside the neo.mjs <a href="../../issues">Issues Tracker</a>
after signing a sponsor program to provide your company logo!

### Thanks a lot for your support of the neo.mjs project!<br/>
