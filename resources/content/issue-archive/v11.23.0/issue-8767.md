# Update buildScripts README to reflect "Application Engine" identity

The `buildScripts/README.md` file still refers to Neo.mjs as a "framework" and lacks the updated "Application Engine" messaging present in the main README.

**Goal:**
- Update `buildScripts/README.md` to align with the project's rebranding.
- Replace "framework" with "Application Engine" or "Platform" where appropriate.
- Ensure the tone reflects the AI-native nature of the toolchain.

**Tasks:**
1.  Read `buildScripts/README.md`.
2.  Replace outdated terminology.
3.  Commit changes.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have updated the `buildScripts/README.md` file to align with the "Application Engine" and "AI-Native" rebranding. 
> - Replaced "framework" with "Application Engine", "platform", or "core base class" where appropriate.
> - Updated the main title to "Neo.mjs Application Engine Build Scripts & CLI Tools".
> 
> This ensures consistent messaging across the documentation.
