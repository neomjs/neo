# Create Test Plan for form.field.Password

This is a Hacktoberfest task to create a comprehensive test plan for the `Neo.form.field.Password` component.

**Component Path:** `src/form/field/Password.mjs`

The goal is **not** to write the test itself, but to produce a detailed ticket file that outlines all the necessary tests. This is done by following our AI-Native "Cookbook" workflow.

## Deliverable

Your pull request should contain a single new file:

-   `.github/ISSUE/ticket-cpm-test-form-field-password.md`

This file will contain the test plan generated by following the cookbook.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Read the Guide:** Before you start, please read the main epic guide carefully:
    - #7475

2.  **Request Assignment:** If you would like to work on this ticket, please leave a comment here asking to be assigned.

3.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Please wait for a project maintainer to confirm your assignment before you start working. This helps prevent multiple contributors from working on the same ticket.

4.  **Start your AI session:** Once your assignment is confirmed, you can begin the work. Start your session with the AI agent by providing the local file paths for both this ticket and the main cookbook epic. This gives the agent the full context. For example:

    > "Hi Gemini, I am assigned to this ticket: `@.github/ISSUE/ticket-component-testing-cookbook-form-field-password.md`. Please use this cookbook as our guide: `@.github/ISSUE/epic-cookbook-create-test-plans.md`."

5.  **Follow the Cookbook:** The cookbook epic will then guide you and the agent through the process of analyzing the component and generating the test plan.

### @JuyaoHuang - 2025-10-14T03:39:36Z

Hi, I'd like to work on this for Hacktoberfest. Could you please assign it to me?

### @tobiu - 2025-10-14T07:44:36Z

Hi, sure I can. The epic is interesting, since it goes quite deep into project management. I created a different epic to migrate existing component test which were written in siesta to playwright: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/7435 . Since there were only very few tests in siesta, I extended the scope, to also test components which do not have any tests yet.

For the other epic this led to a problem: if we can not provide a clear scope on what to test, it is too vague for other hacktoberfest contributors. So the main goal is to identify what makes each component special, and from there define meaningful areas that should get tested. We can easily create 100+ more tickets for components that need testing scopes, and then get tested afterwards. This one is literally the first sub I created here.

### @Alachi24 - 2025-10-14T15:41:35Z

Hi @tobiu 
I'd love to work on some of the incoming `documentation` ticket issues once it's ready, for hacktoberfest.

I also noticed while going through the docs, places like `Contribution.md` doesn't have clear description on how to set up for contribution for new users not well versed in `AI agent` which can prove to be challenging. Only saw the set up at the official site, or at least some of it.

I'd be happy to work on it, given some guides are made for me to use and work on the issue.

### @tobiu - 2025-10-14T16:16:57Z

@Alachi24 I created a new sub for you: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/7488
You need to add a comment there, to enable me to assign it to you (github security policy). This should be an easy one, ideal for warming up.

While the project readme contains the links to the (optional) ai quickstart and working with agents guide, I agree that it could be more prominent, and also get mentioned inside the contributors guidelines. Feel free to create new tickets for it.

### @JuyaoHuang - 2025-10-15T08:07:25Z

Hi @tobiu , thank you for the guidance. I was able to run the build with the flag to get the detailed error logs.

It seems the build is failing due to a common Webpack 5 issue where polyfills for Node.js core modules are no longer included by default. The logs show multiple errors for modules like fs, path, crypto, http, etc. These seem to be required by server-side dependencies like express and the project's own code in the ai/ directory.

The error message suggests adding the --stats-error-details flag to see more details, but the build-all script runs a custom node script (node ./buildScripts/buildAll.mjs -f -n), so I'm not sure how to pass this flag through to Webpack.

Since I can't get a successful build, I'm currently blocked from running the component examples locally, which is a required step in the "Cookbook".

Could you please advise on how to resolve this build configuration issue? I'm posting the full error log below for your reference.

My environment is:

- OS: Windows 11
- Node.js version: v22.14.0

Thank you for your help!

### @tobiu - 2025-10-15T08:09:32Z

maybe a stupid question, but did you use `npm i` first?

### @JuyaoHuang - 2025-10-15T08:14:50Z

@tobiu ,Thank you for checking. I've confirmed that all dependencies are installed correctly. I just ran npm install again, and the output shows everything is up to date: 
  npm i
  up to date, audited 881 packages in 4s
  122 packages are looking for funding
  run npm fund for details
  18 vulnerabilities (2 low, 4 moderate, 12 high)
  To address issues that do not require attention, run:
  npm audit fix
  To address all issues possible, run:
  npm audit fix --force
  Some issues need review, and may require choosing
  a different dependency.
  Run npm audit for details.

Unfortunately, after this confirmation, **running npm run build-all still results in the exact same Webpack 5 build error related to the missing Node.js core module polyfills that I posted earlier.**
It seems the root cause is indeed the build configuration. I'm looking forward to your guidance on how to fix the Webpack setup. Thank you!

### @ad1tyayadav - 2025-10-27T13:13:23Z

@tobiu I'm working on this

### @tobiu - 2025-10-27T13:23:47Z

@JuyaoHuang Sorry, this one fell under the radar (i am quite busy with pushing for v11). I don't have windows, so i can sadly not help much with debugging OS related issues outside Mac OS. Maybe this one could be an option:
https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/learn/guides/ai/AiToolingWslSetup.md

For now, we can re-assign the ticket.
