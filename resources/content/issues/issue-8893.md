# Create Unit Test for Grid VDOM Deltas

Create a Playwright Unit Test (`test/playwright/unit/grid/Teleportation.spec.mjs`) to inspect the low-level VDOM deltas generated during Grid scrolling.

**Requirements:**
- Simulate a `GridContainer` and `GridBody` in the Node.js test environment.
- Manually trigger `afterSetScrollTop` to simulate scrolling.
- Capture the VDOM updates and Deltas generated by `VdomHelper`.
- Verify if the deltas are correctly replacing content or incorrectly appending to recycled nodes.
- Inspect the `TreeBuilder` output for sparse tree generation issues.
