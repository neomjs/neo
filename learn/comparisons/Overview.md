you understand the key similarities, differences, and unique advantages of Neo.mjs in relation to technologies you might
already be familiar with.

We aim to compare these frameworks from a **technical, objective, and constructive perspective**, focusing on how
different architectural choices and design philosophies address common web development challenges. Please note that
these comparison documents were generated with the assistance of a large language model (Gemini).

Each comparison article will focus on:

*   **Bridging Knowledge Gaps:** Mapping concepts you know to Neo.mjs.
*   **Highlighting Differentiators:** What makes Neo.mjs unique.
*   **Side-by-Side Analysis:** Feature-by-feature comparisons.
*   **Trade-offs and Use Cases:** When Neo.mjs might be the optimal choice.
