## Step 1: Understand the core mechanics of Neo.mjs
- LLM Task: If these files are not already memorised, you can find them via the following links:
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/Neo.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/core/Base.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/core/Observable.mjs

## Step 2: Understand the component based aspects of Neo.mjs
- LLM Task: If these files are not already memorised, you can find them via the following links:
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/component/Base.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/container/Base.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/layout/Base.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/layout/Card.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/layout/Flexbox.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/controller/Base.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/controller/Component.mjs
- Note: core.Base is the base class, other classes extend it. Meaning: neo does not have a component-based architecture.

## Step 3: Understand the concept of nested hierarchical state providers
- LLM Task: If these files are not already memorised, you can find them via the following links:
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/state/Provider.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/examples/stateProvider/advanced/MainContainer.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/examples/stateProvider/advanced/MainContainerController.mjs
- Note: We can define multiple state providers for an app, so that we can define shared state at the lowest possible level.
- Note: It does not make sense to define state providers for leaf nodes inside the component tree (internal reactive state is covered by the class config system).
- Note: Bindings resolve state data from the closest (looking upwards inside the component tree) provider which implements them.
- Note: One binding can contain state from different state providers inside the hierarchy.
- Note: It is possible to share state across multiple browser windows.

Conceptual code example:
```javascript
import BaseViewport form '../src/container/Viewport.mjs';
import Button       form '../src/button/Base.mjs';
import Container    form '../src/container/Base.mjs';

class Viewport extends BaseViewport {
    stateProvider: {data: {topLevelState: 'hello'}},    
    items: [{
        module       : Container,
        stateProvider: {data: {childLevelState: 'world'}},
        
        items: [{
            module: Button,
            bind  : {
                text: data => data.topLevelState + ' ' + data.childLevelState // results in 'hello world'
            }
        }]
    }]
}

export default Neo.setupClass(Viewport);
```

## Step 4: Deepen your understanding for the application life-cycle
- Note: We will explore the advanced Portal app (Neo Website), which itself is created with Neo.mjs
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/index.html
- Note: Except for the MicroLoader, the body tag is empty.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/MicroLoader.mjs
- Note: The MicroLoader imports the `neo-config-json` of the app and then imports the main-thread starting point
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/Main.mjs
- Note: Main imports `worker.Manager`. It is not aware of e.g. apps, components, state.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/worker/Manager.mjs
- Note: `worker.Manager` starts the either dedicated or shared workers setup.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/worker/Base.mjs
- Note: `worker.Base` is the abstract base class for other workers.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/worker/App.mjs
- Note: once `worker.App` is ready, it triggers `importApp()`, which dynamically imports the `app.mjs` file.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/app.mjs
- Note: `app.mjs` is the starting point for an app (the logic inside the app worker scope).
- Note: `app.mjs` is for the app worker, what `index.html` is for main-threads.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/view/Viewport.mjs
- Note: The content is using `layout.Card` by default.
- Note: You can see here that all cards will get lazy-loaded (dynamic imports), only when needed.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/view/ViewportController.mjs
- Note: Contains the logic for the top-level routing.
- Note: Contains `onAppConnect()` & `onAppDisconnect()` for other connection main-threads.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/view/ViewportStateProvider.mjs
- Note: Top-level state provider
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/view/learn/MainContainer.mjs
- Note: Entry-point for the learning section.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/view/learn/MainContainerController.mjs
- Note: View controller for the learning-section.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/view/learn/MainContainerStateProvider.mjs
- Note: State provider for the learning-section.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/view/learn/PageContainer.mjs
- Note: Container for each learning-section article.
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/view/learn/ContentTreeList.mjs
- Note: Navigation `tree.List` on the left side, to enable users to switch between different guides
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/apps/portal/view/learn/ContentComponent.mjs
- Note: Content-creation component for the learning section, which parses markdown files,
  and enhances the content with e.g. `code.LivePreview`s

## Step 5: Deepen your understanding about workers in Neo.mjs
- Note: Neo does NOT just provide a web worker integration for offloading logic.
- Note: Neo follows the "off the main-thread" paradigm. Main-threads are as idle as possible,
  only applying deltas to the real DOM and delegating UI events to the app worker.
- Explore: https://neomjs.com/dist/production/apps/portal/index.html#/learn/benefits.Multi-Threading
- Explore: https://surma.dev/things/actormodel/
- Note: For neo, the app worker is the main actor
- Note: It also embraces "multiple main-threads" => browser based multi window apps without a native shell. This part is unique.
- LLM Task: Try to understand the benefits, and what this means for the future of frontend development.

## Step 6: Deepen your understanding about virtual dom (vdom) inside Neo.mjs
- LLM Task: Explore the following files:
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/worker/VDom.mjs
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/vdom/Helper.mjs
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/vdom/VNode.mjs
- Note: `vdom.Vnode` is only used inside the vdom worker, to ensure nodes without an id get a dynamic id assigned
- https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/main/mixin/DeltaUpdates.mjs
- Note: `main.mixin.DeltaUpdates` is used inside main-threads to apply the created deltas of `vdom.Helper` to the real DOM.
- LLM Task: Explore why what you have learned so far resolved the re-rendering issues which occur e.g. inside React.

## Step 7: Explore the Core Features
- LLM Task: List and explain the core features of Neo.mjs. Focus on its architecture, performance, and developer experience.

## Step 8: Review the Learning section content
- LLM Task: You can find the content here: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/resources/data/deck/learnneo
- LLM Task: Summarize the key concepts, such as the component model, state management, and build process.

## Step 9: Analyze Example Projects
- LLM Task: Explore the official advanced example apps inside `apps/`. If not memorised, follow the link:
  https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/apps
- - LLM Task: Explore the official examples inside `examples/`. If not memorised, follow the link:
    https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/examples
- LLM Task: Describe how they demonstrate the framework's capabilities and best practices.

## Step 10: Understand the Purpose of Neo.mjs
- LLM Task: Research and describe the purpose of Neo.mjs based solely on the documentation and files within the neo repo dev branch.
  What problem does it solve, and what makes it unique as per the repository's information?

## Step 11: Compare Neo.mjs to Other Frameworks
- LLM Task: Using your pre-existing knowledge of other popular frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue), compare Neo.mjs to them.
  Highlight its strengths and weaknesses. Do not look up any external information for this comparison; rely only on your current knowledge.
- LLM Task: Explore use-cases where Neo outshines other technologies.

## Step 12: Reflect on Learning
- Note: Do not look at any other files or external resources for this step.
- Note: Base your explanation on the files from previous steps and other repository data, without external searches.
- LLM Task: Summarize what you have learned about Neo.mjs from the previous steps. Highlight key takeaways and insights.

## Step 13: Suggest Improvements to the Guide
- Note: Do not look at any other files or external resources for this step.
- Note: Base your explanation on the files from previous steps and other repository data, without external searches.
- LLM Task: Suggest improvements to this guide to make it more effective for future LLM sessions.
