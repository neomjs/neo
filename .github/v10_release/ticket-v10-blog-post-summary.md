# Ticket: Create v10 Top-Level Blog Post

## 1. Goal
Create the main "hub" blog post for the v10 release. This post should be a high-level, compelling summary of the new features and their benefits.

## 2. Target Audience
All web developers, including those from other framework ecosystems (React, Vue, etc.). The tone should be exciting and accessible, using analogies to explain complex topics.

## 3. Content Plan & Narrative

**Title:** Neo.mjs v10: The Reactive, Multi-Threaded Framework You've Been Waiting For

**Opening Hook:** Start by addressing a universal pain point: "Is your main thread holding your application hostage? What if you could build complex, data-heavy UIs that run silky-smooth by default, because the framework was designed from the ground up to move the hard work off the main thread?" This immediately introduces the core differentiator of Neo.mjs.

---

### Section 1: A Modern, Functional UI Layer You'll Love
*   **Focus:** Introduce `defineComponent` and `useConfig`. This is the most relatable entry point for developers coming from React/Vue.
*   **Narrative:** "We've built a modern, hook-based functional UI layer that will feel right at home. But this is just the beginning. This familiar API is supercharged by Neo.mjs's unique architecture."
*   **Visuals:** A simple code snippet showing a functional component.

---

### Section 2: Effortless State Management with "Two-Tier Reactivity"
*   **Focus:** Explain the power and flexibility of the new reactivity model.
*   **Narrative:** "Neo.mjs offers a revolutionary 'Two-Tier' reactivity system. Need the automatic, 'spreadsheet-style' magic of declarative effects? You've got it. Need the fine-grained control of imperative hooks? It's there too. They work together seamlessly, giving you the right tool for every job."
*   **Analogy:** Use the "Subscription Service" vs. "Manual Phone Tree" analogy from the brainstorm document.

### Section 3: The Performance Powerhouse: Asymmetric VDOM Updates
*   **Focus:** This is where we introduce the star of the performance story.
*   **Narrative:** "We've moved beyond the traditional Virtual DOM. Our new VDOM engine performs **asymmetric updates**. When a parent and a deeply nested child change at the same time, we don't re-render the whole tree. We create a single, surgical payload with the changes, telling the renderer to ignore everything else. The result is hyper-efficient updates and unparalleled performance."
*   **Analogy:** "Instead of sending a blueprint for the whole building, we send a blueprint for just the one room that changed."

---

### Section 4: Secure by Design
*   **Focus:** A quick, impactful point on security.
*   **Narrative:** "In today's web, security can't be an afterthought. Neo.mjs helps you build safer apps by default, automatically protecting you from common XSS vulnerabilities by design."

---

### Section 5: The Bigger Picture
*   **Focus:** Briefly mention the other key pillars that enable this.
*   **Narrative:** "All of this is made possible by a suite of architectural innovations, including an intelligent state provider model that makes managing complex data hierarchies feel intuitive. We'll explore all these topics in our deep-dive series."

---

### Call to Action
*   **Focus:** Guide the reader to the next steps.
*   **Narrative:** "Ready to experience the future of web development? Explore our new functional component examples, and when you're ready to see how it all works, dive into our technical articles."
*   **Links:**
    *   Link to the functional component examples.
    *   Link to the "hub" page for the deep-dive blog posts.

## 4. Deliverable
A complete draft of the blog post as a markdown file, following this new structure.
