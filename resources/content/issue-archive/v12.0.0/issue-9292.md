# Fix DevIndex pipeline data paths after directory refactoring

### Problem
The recent refactoring of the DevIndex data storage (moving `users.jsonl` and related data files to `apps/devindex/resources/data/`) broke the automated commit step in the hourly GitHub Actions pipeline (`devindex-pipeline.yml`). The workflow was still trying to `git add` and check `git status` on the old `apps/devindex/resources/*.json*` path.

### Solution
Update the paths in the `devindex-pipeline.yml` workflow to point to the new `data/` subdirectory.

```yaml
# Check for changes in specific files
if [[ -n $(git status -s apps/devindex/resources/data/*.json*) ]]; then
  echo "Changes detected in data files."

  # Stage the files
  git add apps/devindex/resources/data/*.json*
```

**Input from Gemini 3.1 Pro:**

> ✦ The `devindex-pipeline.yml` workflow has been successfully updated to use the new `apps/devindex/resources/data/*.json*` path. The automated hourly commit job will now correctly detect and push changes generated by the spider and updater scripts.
