# Epic: Make Knowledge Base Tools Self-Documenting

To streamline agent instructions and reduce the size of AGENTS.md, we need to move tool-specific documentation directly into the tool definitions themselves. This makes the tools self-sufficient and easier to understand.

This epic covers the work to enhance the OpenAPI specification for the Knowledge Base server, making its tools, especially `query_documents`, fully self-documenting.
