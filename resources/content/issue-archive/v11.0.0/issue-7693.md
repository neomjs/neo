# Docs: Clarify Scope of Ticket-First Gate in AGENTS.md

This issue is to track the enhancement of the `AGENTS.md` file. The "Ticket-First Gate" protocol will be updated to explicitly state that it applies to all files within the repository, including `AGENTS.md` itself. This clarification is necessary to prevent a recurring failure mode where the agent skips ticket creation for "meta" files concerning its own instructions.
