# vdom.Helper polishing

* Converted `voidAttributes` from an Array to a set, modified the content
* Converted `voidElements` from an Array to a set, modified the content
* Added `rawDimensionTags` to ensure SVG tag related content will not have specific attributes getting converted into styles (e.g. height and width)
* `form.field.Text`: fixed a memory leak => Triggers did not get destroyed properly.
