# jsdoc-x (ESM Rewrite)

This directory contains an ES module (ESM) rewrite of the excellent `jsdoc-x` library by Onury (https://github.com/onury/jsdoc-x).

**Kudos to Onury** for the original work and the foundational logic that this rewrite is based upon.

This version has been adapted to use modern ES6+ features, native Promises, and to remove outdated dependencies, providing a cleaner and more efficient solution for processing JSDoc output within the Neo.mjs framework.
