# Neo.mjs v11.4.0 Release Notes

This release further enhances our Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) capabilities, improves sitemap generation, and refines the main thread addon for handling document metadata, continuing our focus on deep integration with modern web standards and AI ecosystems.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🌐 Advanced SEO & Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

-   **Multiple JSON-LD Schemas**: The main portal page now includes three distinct `application/ld+json` schemas: one for the core framework, one for the AI-native development platform, and a comprehensive FAQ page. This provides rich, structured data to generative engines, significantly improving how they understand and represent Neo.mjs. (Issue #7776)
-   **Sitemap Priority Tagging**: The sitemap generation script (`buildScripts/generateSeoFiles.mjs`) now adds `<priority>` tags to the `sitemap.xml`. This helps search engines better understand the relative importance of pages, with high-value content like tutorials and guides getting higher priority. (Issue #7775)

### 🏗️ Framework & API Improvements

-   **Enhanced DocumentHead Addon**: The `DocumentHead` main thread addon has been upgraded to support multiple `ld+json` schemas on a single page. The `getLdJson` and `setLdJson` methods can now target specific schemas using a `data-schema-name` attribute, while maintaining full backward compatibility for existing apps. (Issue #7777)
