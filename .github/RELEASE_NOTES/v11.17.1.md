# Neo.mjs v11.17.1 Release Notes

**Release Type:** Patch Release
**Stability:** Production-ready
**Upgrade Path:** Drop-in replacement for v11.17.0

---

This patch release addresses a configuration oversight in v11.17.0 where newly added applications were excluded from the npm distribution.

## 📦 Improvements

### 🛠️ Infrastructure
*   **NPM Configuration:** Synchronized `.npmignore` with `.gitignore`. This ensures that the new **AgentOS**, **Legit**, and **Neural Link** applications are correctly included in the npm package (#8154).
