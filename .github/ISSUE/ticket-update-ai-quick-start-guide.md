# Ticket: Update AI Quick Start Guide

GH ticket id: #7295

**Assignee:** Gemini
**Status:** In Progress

## Description

The AI Quick Start Guide (`.github/AI_QUICK_START.md`) needs to be updated based on feedback from a new user session.

### Tasks:

1.  **Update Node.js Version:** The current requirement is `v18+`, which is too low. It should be updated to `v20+`.
2.  **Add Gemini CLI Installation Instructions:** The guide assumes the user has the Gemini CLI installed but does not provide the installation command. A new section or paragraph should be added to explain how to install it globally via npm (`npm i -g @google/generative-ai/cli`).
