# Neo.mjs v10.5.1 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

### table.Body
- Fixed a JavaScript error that occurred when filtering a table's store. A previous change modified the method signature of `onStoreLoad()` to expect a destructured object containing the store's items. However, the `onStoreFilter()` method was not updated to reflect this change and continued to call `onStoreLoad()` without the required arguments.
- `onStoreFilter()` now correctly passes the store's data to `onStoreLoad()`, resolving the error and ensuring that table filtering works as expected.
