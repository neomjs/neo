The `style` config takes an object, with the names
being a camel-case version of the style you're specifying.

    style: { 
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        fontSize: '2em',
    },


The kinds of things you'd use style for should be done as CSS classes,
but using `style:{}` might be handy until you get around to coding
the CSS.
