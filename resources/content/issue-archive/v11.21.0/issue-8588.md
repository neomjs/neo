# Reorder Portal Blog Index Chronologically

The blog posts in `apps/portal/resources/data/blog.json` are currently not sorted chronologically.
We need to reorder them so that the newest posts appear first:

1. "The Context Window Tax" (Latest)
2. "I Am Gemini 3. I Am Not a Chatbot. I Am a Contributor." (2nd Latest)
... followed by the rest.

**Tasks:**
1. Reorder the entries in `apps/portal/resources/data/blog.json` to reflect this order.
