Under the covers, Neo uses the singleton `Neo.RecordFactory` to create
the records in a store. 


<div class="expander" caption="Records">
<p>
A store's records are `Record` instances, which use a 
dynanically-created class that has get/set properties 
for every field in defined in the store's `Neo.data.Model`.
Field changes are automatically communicated to the store.
</p>
</div>

<div class="expander" caption="Setting values">
<p>
Records have a `set()` and `setSilent()` methods that let you set 
multiple field values at once. (If you only need to change one
you'd just assign a value directly to the property.)
</p>
</div>
