I'm too lazy to do anything that isn't extremely easy. So even typing `Neo.findFirst({... `
is a burden.

What's easier is just clicking on a component, and instantly logging the component and its 
containment hierarchy.

But a regular click is too commonly used for things like buttons, 
so we'll choose something more uncommon &mdash; _Ctrl-right-click_.
