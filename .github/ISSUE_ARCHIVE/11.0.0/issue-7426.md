# Docs: Modernize CONTRIBUTING.md

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-10-09

This ticket documents the modernization of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to ensure its content is up-to-date and its policies are clear for new contributors.

The following changes were made:

1.  **Added Inactive Assignee Policy:** A new rule was added to section 3.2. It states that an assigned ticket may be re-assigned if the assignee is unresponsive for more than 7 days. This is intended to prevent tickets from stalling and keep project momentum.

2.  **Rewrote Outdated Introduction:** Section 1, which was written when the project was first released, has been completely rewritten. The new text removes outdated language ("just got released"), updates platform names (Twitter -> X), and adopts a more professional tone suitable for a mature open-source project.
