A picker is a base class that introduces a `tigger:[]` config. 

A trigger is a widget docked on the right of a field. A text
field can configure any set of triggers that are needed.
(A _clearable_ text field is just a text field with a `Clear` trigger
dynamically added.)

Picker sub-classes are components that are pre-configured to use
one of the `Neo.form.field.trigger.*` triggers.
