# Neo.mjs v11.10.0 Release Notes

This release significantly enhances the **Agent OS Knowledge Base** by expanding its scope to include the entire AI infrastructure, the automated test suite, and a retroactive history of the project. These changes ensure that AI agents have a complete, 360-degree view of the framework—from source code and tests to historical decision-making.

## ✨ Highlights

### 📚 Expanded Knowledge Base: Tests & AI Infrastructure

We have bridged the gap between the framework's source code and its supporting ecosystem. The Knowledge Base now indexes:
-   **AI Infrastructure (`ai/`):** The Agent OS SDK, MCP servers, and services are now fully indexed. Agents can now query the `Neo.ai` namespace to understand their own architecture.
-   **Automated Tests (`test/playwright/`):** Agents can now query for test specifications via **semantic search** using the new `type: 'test'` filter. This allows finding relevant tests by meaning rather than just keywords, helping agents understand how to write and maintain Playwright tests for the framework.
-   **Retroactive History:** We have backfilled the repository with tickets and release notes starting from **January 1st, 2025 (v8.0.1+)**. Previously limited to v10+, this expanded history gives agents a deeper context on the framework's evolution and design decisions.

### 📖 Docs App: AI Namespace Integration

The [Docs App](https://neomjs.com/docs) has been updated to include the `Neo.ai` namespace.
-   **Visualizing the AI SDK:** Developers can now browse the class hierarchy of the AI infrastructure (e.g., `Neo.ai.mcp.server.knowledge-base.Server`).
-   **Smart Filtering:** We implemented intelligent filtering (via the new `doesNotStartWith` operator and `@ignoreDocs` tag) to ensure only relevant classes are displayed, keeping the navigation tree clean.

### 🧹 Standardization & Code Quality

We have enforced stricter coding guidelines to improve documentation quality and consistency:
-   **JSDoc Standardization:** The `@ summary` tag is now mandatory as the first tag for all classes, ensuring concise high-level descriptions.
-   **MCP Tool Signatures:** All MCP server tools now use standardized method signatures with default object arguments, improving robustness and error handling.
