# Ticket: Add Intent-Driven JSDoc to src/component/Circle.mjs

**Assignee:** Gemini
**Status:** Done

## Description

The file `src/component/Circle.mjs` is missing intent-driven JSDoc comments at the class level. This makes it harder for developers and AI agents to quickly understand the purpose and context of the class.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Add a `@summary` tag to the class-level JSDoc of `Neo.component.Circle`.
2.  Add a detailed description to the class-level JSDoc that explains the component's role, key features (like the circular layout, expand/collapse functionality, and draggable items), and its architectural context.
3.  Ensure the new comments follow the guidelines in `.github/CODING_GUIDELINES.md`.
