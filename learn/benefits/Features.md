Neo.mjs is engineered to address the most pressing challenges in modern web development, offering a suite of features
that deliver unparalleled performance, developer productivity, and architectural flexibility. Below are the core
capabilities that set Neo.mjs apart.

## Multi-Window Applications

Neo.mjs provides native, robust support for applications spanning multiple browser windows without the need for external
shells like Electron. This enables seamless data and state sharing across windows, allowing components to be moved between
them while maintaining their JavaScript instances. This capability is crucial for complex enterprise applications requiring
sophisticated multi-screen workflows.

## True Multi-threading (Off-Main-Thread Architecture)

At the heart of Neo.mjs is its revolutionary Off-Main-Thread (OMT) paradigm. Your entire application, including the
framework itself, runs within a dedicated application worker. This offloads all business logic, data processing, and
intensive UI updates from the main thread, ensuring a consistently non-blocking, freeze-free user experience, even during
heavy computations or data I/O. Neo.mjs further enhances this with additional workers for OffscreenCanvas, data handling,
delta-updates, and tasks, alongside a ServiceWorker for predictive caching.

## Modern JavaScript Development

Embrace the future of web development with Neo.mjs. Its development mode operates without the need for transpilation or
compilation, allowing you to work directly with 100% web standards-based JavaScript. This means instant feedback, simpler
debugging, and the ability to leverage the latest ECMAScript features as soon as browser support is available,
significantly reducing development costs and accelerating iteration cycles.

## Powerful Component Library

Neo.mjs offers a comprehensive and highly performant component library. Build complex user interfaces with declarative
component trees and high-order components. The library includes a wide array of out-of-the-box components, such as 
ested lazy-loaded forms, and supports multiple theming options that can be nested for granular control over your
application's aesthetics.

## Elegant State Management

Manage your application's data with Neo.mjs's elegant state management system. It supports multiple communicating state
providers and leverages observable patterns for reactive data flows. This flexible approach allows you to adopt various
architectural patterns, like MVVM, without being rigidly enforced, giving you the freedom to choose the best fit for
your project.

## Core Architectural Features

*   **RPC Layer**: A robust Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layer facilitates seamless, cross-realm communication,
  extending even to backend integrations.
*   **Extensibility & Scalability**: The framework is designed for maximum extensibility, allowing you to easily integrate
  custom logic and scale your applications from small prototypes to large-scale enterprise solutions.
*   **Class Config System**: A unified, declarative class config system simplifies component definition and management,
  ensuring consistency across your entire application.
*   **Drag & Drop**: Built-in support for intuitive drag-and-drop interactions enhances user experience.
*   **Mixins, Plugins & Main-Thread Addons**: A rich set of tools for extending functionality, integrating third-party
  libraries, and interacting with the main browser thread when necessary.

Neo.mjs's feature set is meticulously crafted to provide a superior development experience and deliver high-performance,
scalable, and maintainable web applications that stand out in today's demanding digital landscape.
