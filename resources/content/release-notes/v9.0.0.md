# Get driven string based listener resolvings

* Before v9, `controller.Component` did parse views to resolve string based listeners, domListeners, button handlers & references
* For more dynamic structures (like a buffered grid cycling components inside component based columns), this static resolving can become expensive
* `controller.Component` will no longer parse components at all
* Instead, the very first time an event actually fires, string based event handlers will get resolved at this point
* Handlers which never get executed won't get touched at all

The new version also removed the vdom engine bypassing shortcut for changing styles
* It made sense before scoped vdom updates were in place (performance)
* Since we have these, the vdom engine needed to become the single source of truth again
* Changing layouts (especially the Cube layout) needs more polishing
