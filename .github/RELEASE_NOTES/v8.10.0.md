# Grid Selection Models

All Grid related selection models now have basic navigation support.
Videos inside the tickets.

* CellModel: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6300
* ColumnModel: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6302
* CellColumnModel: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6305
* CellRowModel: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6306
* CellColumnRowModel : https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6307

Table selection models got moved from `table.Container` into `table.View`.
Using the config on a container is `deprecated`, but will continue to work until Neo v9.

Just switch from `{selectionModel: CellModel}` to `{viewConfig: {selectionModel: CellModel}}`

All spots inside the neo examples are already adjusted.

This change finally removes the need for selection models to increase the `updateDepth`: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6309

The selection models look best using the dark theme and the new light theme is not finished yet.
