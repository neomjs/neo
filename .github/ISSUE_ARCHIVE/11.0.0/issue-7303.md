# Add Temporary Hacktoberfest Onboarding Protocol to AGENTS.md

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-09-28

To provide a more personalized and effective onboarding experience for Hacktoberfest contributors, a temporary protocol needs to be added to the `AGENTS.md` file. This protocol will instruct the AI agent to engage in a brief, conversational process to guide new contributors to suitable tasks based on their skills and interests.

### Tasks:

1.  Add a new, clearly marked temporary section to `AGENTS.md` for the "Hacktoberfest 2025 Onboarding Protocol".
2.  The protocol must instruct the agent to ask inclusive questions about the contributor's background (e.g., developer, designer, writer) and interests (e.g., coding, UI/UX, documentation).
3.  Based on the user's answers, the agent should recommend a suitable contribution path or a specific starter ticket.
4.  The protocol should only be active for the duration of October 2025.
