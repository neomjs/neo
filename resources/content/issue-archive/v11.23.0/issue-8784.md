# Refine Portal Hero with Conversational UI & Authority Messaging

Update `apps/portal/view/home/parts/hero/Content.mjs` to reflect the "Operating System vs. Printer" narrative and emphasize Conversational UIs.

**1. Refine `cycleTexts`:**
*   'The Application Engine for the AI Era'
*   'Conversational UIs'
*   'Agentic Control'
*   'The Neural Link'
*   'Live Runtime Mutation'
*   'AI-Native Runtime'
*   'JSON Blueprints since 2019'
*   'Object Permanence'
*   'Context Engineering'
*   'True Multithreading'
*   'Desktop-Class Performance'
*   'Multi-Window Orchestration'
*   'Cross-Window Messaging'
*   'Zero Build Step'
*   '100% Web Standards'
*   'Instant Page Reloads'

**2. Update H3 Sub-headline:**
Replace the current text with:
"Neo.mjs is the Application Engine for the AI Era. Build desktop-class, multi-window apps where AI agents can see, understand, and control the runtime—enabling the next generation of Conversational UIs."
