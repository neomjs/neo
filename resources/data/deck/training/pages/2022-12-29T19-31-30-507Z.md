Neo enables you to create scalable and high performant 
browser-based apps.

<p>
Normal browser apps run in as a single thread in one processer. 
That means that apps that are processor-intensive — such as doing 
massive dom updates — are limited by what the one processer can handle.

<p>
Neo uses three (or more) web workers — so three processors are used.
One thread holds your app logic, one handles HTTP/Ajax calls, and
one handles DOM updates.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the DOM updates are intelligently handled via
delta updates, rather than re-rendering large DOM hierarchies.
Neo can handle tens of thousands of DOM updates _per second_.

<p>
There are other advantages, such as lazy loading any part of the
running app, and multi-window apps, where a single app can be run
in multiple browser window.
