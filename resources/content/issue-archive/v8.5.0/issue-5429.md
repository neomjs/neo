hi @TheCoderAdi!

the PR looks fine to me. I just took another look into the hacktoberfest rules, and if i understand them correctly, only PRs starting from October 1 count. If I am right on this one, you should re-send the PR on Tuesday, to ensure that you get the events credits.

Best regards,
Tobias

### @TheCoderAdi - 2024-09-29T11:20:04Z

Thank you for taking the time to review my PR! I really appreciate your
feedback.

I'll hold off on any further pull/merge requests until October so they can
count toward the event.

Looking forward to contributing once it starts!

Best regards,
Aditya Swayamsiddha

I hope you're doing well! Since Hacktoberfest has officially started, I wanted to kindly request if you could merge the pull request I recently submitted. This will allow the contribution to count towards the event, and I'd be thrilled to see it make a positive impact.

Thank you for your time and support!
