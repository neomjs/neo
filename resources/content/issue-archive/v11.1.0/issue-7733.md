# Blog Post: The Context Engineering Revolution with v11

This blog post will announce the v11.0.0 release, focusing on the theme of "Context Engineering". It will build upon the previous blog post, "AI-Native, Not AI-Assisted," and detail the evolution from shell-based scripts to a robust, multi-server Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture.

**Key points to cover:**

1.  **The Context Engineering Revolution:** Frame the release around this central theme.
2.  **From Scripts to Servers:** Explain the move from brittle shell scripts to three dedicated MCP servers (Knowledge Base, Memory Core, GitHub Workflow).
3.  **Benefits of the New Architecture:**
    *   Robustness and reliability.
    *   Agent-agnosticism.
    *   Self-hosting (dogfooding Neo.mjs).
    *   Simplified agent onboarding.
    *   Self-documenting tools.
4.  **Agent-Driven Quality:** Highlight the migration to Playwright, which enables agents to run `npm test` and validate their own changes.
5.  **Community Contributions:** Acknowledge the massive contributions from the community during Hacktoberfest 2025.
6.  **Future Vision:** Reiterate the project's commitment to the AI-native roadmap and the "Context Engineering" vision.
7.  **Title:** "The Context Engineering Revolution: How We Built a Self-Aware Development Environment" (or similar).
