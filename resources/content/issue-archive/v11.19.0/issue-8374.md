# Update MCP Introduction Guide to Include Neural Link

The `learn/guides/mcp/Introduction.md` guide currently lists only 3 MCP servers. With the introduction of the Neural Link server, the guide is now outdated.

Tasks:
- Update the introduction text to reflect 4 MCP servers.
- Add a section for the "Neural Link" server.
- Update the "Agent OS" Architecture section.
