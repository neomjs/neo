# Neo.mjs v10.5.2 Release Notes

## Features

- **grid.Container**: Added the `aria-colcount` attribute to the grid's wrapper element to enhance accessibility.
- This attribute dynamically updates with the number of columns, ensuring screen readers can accurately announce the grid's structure.

## Enhancements

- **grid.Container**: The `updateColCount()` method now includes a `silent` parameter. This allows for updating the column count without triggering an immediate DOM update, optimizing performance in scenarios where multiple changes occur in sequence.
- **examples.grid.bigData.ControlsContainer**: To improve user feedback, a loading mask is now displayed during the initial data filtering process in the Big Data grid example.

## Bug Fixes

- **data.Store**: Fixed an issue where the `isLoaded` flag was not set to `true` when records were added to the store via
  the `add()` method. This ensures that the `load` event is fired correctly, even when the store is populated manually
  instead of through assigning `data` or `autoLoad`.
