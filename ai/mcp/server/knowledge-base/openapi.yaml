        ChromaDB vector database.

        Use this tool as a first step to diagnose issues if other database-related
        tools are failing. It provides a quick status check on the server and its
        primary dependency.

        Triggers the full knowledge base synchronization process. This is a long-running,
        asynchronous operation that orchestrates the 'create' and 'embed' processes in sequence.

        **When to Use:**
        Use this tool when you want to rebuild the entire knowledge base from the latest
        source files in one step. This is the most common way to update the database.

        Creates (or overwrites) the knowledge base JSONL file from all source materials.
        This is the first step in the synchronization process and does not affect the vector database.

        **When to Use:**
        Use this tool if you only need to generate the intermediate `ai-knowledge-base.jsonl` file
        for inspection or debugging, without incurring the cost and time of embedding.

        Embeds the content from the existing knowledge base JSONL file into the vector database.

        **When to Use:**
        Use this tool after manually verifying or modifying the `ai-knowledge-base.jsonl` file,
        or if a previous embedding process was interrupted. It assumes the JSONL file is already correct.

        Performs a semantic search on the knowledge base using a natural language query.
        Returns a scored and ranked list of the most relevant source files.

        ## How to Use This Tool
        
        **Input:**
        - `query`: Natural language search query (1-10 words work best)
        - `type`: Optional filter by content type (all, blog, guide, src, example, ticket, release)
        
        **Output:**
        A ranked list of file paths with relevance scores. Example:
        ```
        Most relevant source files (by weighted score):
        - /path/to/relevant/file1.mjs (Score: 350)
        - /path/to/relevant/file2.md (Score: 210)
        - /path/to/relevant/file3.mjs (Score: 150)
        
        Top result: /path/to/relevant/file1.mjs
        ```
        
        ## How to Interpret Results
        
        1. **Start with the top result**: Always read the highest-scoring file first.
        2. **Scan the next 5-10 results**: Check both file types and scores.
        3. **Balance source and guides**: Read top 1-2 source files (.mjs) AND top 1-2 guides (.md).
           - `.mjs` files: Implementation details, actual code
           - `.md` files: Conceptual context, architectural rationale
        4. **Prioritize content types**:
           - `guide` and `src`: Current best practices and implementation
           - `blog`: Historical context (code examples may be outdated)
           - `example`: Concrete usage patterns
           - `ticket`: Can be historical context (**closed tickets**) or potential work items (**open tickets**). Distinguish between them carefully.
        
        ## Query Strategies

        ### The Discovery Pattern: Broad to Narrow
        When learning about a new concept or feature area:

        1.  **Start Broad:** Query foundational concepts first.
            - For high-level questions, consult `learn/tree.json` to identify key concepts.
            - Use terms like `"benefits"`, `"architecture"`, `"fundamentals"`.
            - Prioritize reading guides from top-level directories.

        2.  **Narrow to Specifics:** Use broad results to formulate targeted queries.
            - `query_documents(query='Button component examples')`
            - `query_documents(query='what is Neo.component.Base?')`

        3.  **Filter by Type:** Use the `type` parameter for focused results.
            - Conceptual: `type='guide'`
            - Usage examples: `type='example'`
            - Implementation: `type='src'`
            - Historical context: `type='ticket'` or `type='blog'`

        ## When Queries Return No Results

        If queries consistently return no relevant results for your task:

        **Pause and document the gap:**
        - Clearly describe what you were trying to accomplish
        - List the queries you attempted (show your work)
        - Explain why existing results were insufficient
        - Consult with the user about next steps

        **Before implementing based on assumptions:**
        - Explain the knowledge gap you've identified
        - Propose your approach and its basis (general software patterns, analogous Neo.mjs patterns, etc.)
        - Get explicit user approval to proceed

        ## Handling Failures
        
        If this tool fails or throws an error:
        1. Run the `healthcheck` tool to diagnose the issue.
        2. If unhealthy, consult `.github/AI_QUICK_START.md` for setup guidance.

            Natural language search query. Best practices:
            - Keep queries concise (1-10 words)
            - Use specific technical terms when known
            - Start broad, then narrow based on results
            - Example good queries: "Button component", "state management patterns", 
              "afterSet hook implementation", "multi-window architecture"
          example: "How do I use the Tab Container component?"
