# Rebrand Neo.mjs to "Application Engine" in Documentation

Update `learn/` content to align with the "Application Engine" positioning.

**Changes:**
- `learn/tree.json`: Renamed "Comparisons" to "Engine vs Frameworks".
- `learn/comparisons/Overview.md`: Updated title and intro to contrast Engine vs Frameworks.
- `learn/guides/fundamentals/CodebaseOverview.md`: Updated "core framework" to "core engine" in metrics and headers.
- `learn/benefits/OffTheMainThread.md`: Updated "framework" to "engine".
- `learn/benefits/Features.md`: Updated "framework" to "engine".
- `learn/benefits/FourEnvironments.md`: Updated "framework" to "platform".
- `learn/comparisons/NeoVsReact.md`: Refined comparison terminology (frameworks -> architectures/systems).
