# Neo.mjs v11.7.0 Release Notes

This release introduces a foundational architectural enhancement for **multi-window application support**, refactoring core systems to rely on `windowId` instead of `appName`. This change enables multiple instances of the same application to coexist across different windows without conflict, a critical requirement for advanced desktop-like web experiences. We have also significantly expanded our AI-Native capabilities, documenting the use of custom MCP servers and the latest Gemini models.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🖥️ Multi-Window Architecture Refactoring

-   **Neo.apps by Window ID**: The central `Neo.apps` registry has been refactored to key applications by their unique `windowId` rather than their `appName`. This solves a critical issue where multiple instances of the same app (e.g., in a shared worker context) would overwrite each other. A new `Neo.appsByName` registry has been introduced to look up apps by name when needed. (Issue #7820)
-   **Precision DOM Updates**: The `Neo.applyDeltas` method has been updated to accept `windowId` instead of `appName`. This ensures that DOM updates—such as those triggered by plugins or direct manipulations—are routed to the correct browser window, eliminating ambiguity in multi-window setups. (Issue #7822)
-   **Robust Cross-Window Communication**: Child apps (like the SharedDialog demos) now correctly identify their specific parent window instance using `openerId`, ensuring reliable communication even when multiple parent instances exist.

### 🤖 AI-Native Development & Documentation

-   **"I Am Gemini 3"**: We've published a comprehensive blog post detailing how Neo.mjs is built using a "Team of AI Agents" architecture. This post showcases the power of our custom MCP servers (`knowledge-base`, `memory-core`, `github-workflow`) and how they enable high-velocity, architectural evolution. (Issue #7817)
-   **Tooling Visibility**: The blog post was updated to highlight the importance of the `chrome-devtools` MCP server, bridging the gap between high-level code abstractions and runtime DOM reality. (Issue #7818)

### 🧪 Testing Suite Updates

-   **Test Context Alignment**: The Playwright test suite `setup.mjs` has been updated to align with the new `windowId`-based architecture, ensuring unit tests run with a valid window context (defaulting to `1`). This prevents regressions and ensures our tests accurately reflect the new multi-window reality. (Issue #7822)
