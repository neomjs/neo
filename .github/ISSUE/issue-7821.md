# [MCP] Support issue comments in create_comment tool

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The `create_comment` tool currently only supports Pull Requests. However, interacting with Issues (adding comments) is a common workflow requirement.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Extend the `create_comment` tool (or create a new one) to support adding comments to GitHub Issues, not just PRs.

**Additional context**
Current tool limitation was identified during an interactive session where an issue comment was attempted but failed.
