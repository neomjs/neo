# Ticket: Enhance Helix Example with Query-Driven Comments

GH ticket id: #7236

**Assignee:** Gemini
**Status:** Done

## Description

Following the newly formalized documentation standards, the Helix viewport example (`examples/component/helix/Viewport.mjs`) was updated with comprehensive, query-driven JSDoc comments.

This also included fixing a bug where the `text` config was incorrectly used to render HTML content.

## Changes

-   **`examples/component/helix/Viewport.mjs`:**
    -   Added a detailed, class-level `@summary` explaining the purpose of the component and the key Neo.mjs concepts it demonstrates (e.g., Component Lifecycle, Reactivity, 3D transformations).
    -   Enriched the summary with conceptual keywords to improve discoverability via semantic search.
    -   Documented all major configs, correctly applying the `@reactive` tag and using access modifiers (`@protected`) appropriately.
    -   Added comments to the `construct()` and `afterSet*()` methods to explain their logic and purpose.
    -   Corrected a bug by changing a `text` config to `html` for a label that renders HTML, adhering to framework security and best practices.

## Impact

The Helix example is now a well-documented, self-explanatory resource that is easily discoverable by the AI knowledge base. It serves as a prime example of the high documentation standard expected for all framework code.
