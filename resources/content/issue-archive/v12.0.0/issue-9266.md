# Update ContentEngine guide with DevIndex-specific examples

**Objective:**
Update `learn/guides/devindex/frontend/ContentEngine.md` to use DevIndex-specific examples instead of inheriting examples from the main Portal app.

**Tasks:**
- Update the `tree.json` snippet to reflect the structure of `learn/guides/devindex/tree.json`.
- Update URL hashes and file path mappings in the text to use DevIndex paths (e.g. `frontend/Architecture.md`).
- Update Mermaid diagram to use a DevIndex-specific URL hash.

**Input from Gemini 3.1 Pro:**

> ✦ I have updated the `ContentEngine.md` guide to use a DevIndex-specific `tree.json` snippet, and I replaced all references to the portal app (`benefits/Introduction`, `WorkerArchitecture`) with DevIndex paths (`frontend/Architecture`).
> 
> These changes have been committed and pushed to `dev`. Closing this issue.
