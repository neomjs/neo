Components and other classes fire _events_. Those events run a callback
function called the event _listener_ or _handler_.

For example, buttons fire _click_ events, tables
fire  _select_ events, and stores fire _load_ events.

The usual way to configure to an event is with the `listeners` config. 

    listeners: {
        select: 'onTableSelect'
    },
