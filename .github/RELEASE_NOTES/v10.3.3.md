# Neo.mjs v10.3.3 Release Notes

This patch release introduces a major new deep-dive article on our rendering architecture and enhances our framework comparison documentation.

## New Content & Documentation

- **New Blog Post: The Surgical Update: From JSON Blueprints to Flawless UI**
  - A comprehensive deep dive into the Neo.mjs off-thread rendering engine.
  - Explores key concepts like the secure `DomApiRenderer`, asymmetric update batching, and how our architecture preserves DOM state (e.g., for a playing `<video>`).
  - This is the fourth article in the v10 blog post series.

- **Enhanced Framework Comparisons**
  - The comparison documents for React, Vue, and Angular have been updated with a new section: **"Component Mobility: Portals vs. True Persistence."**
  - This section details the architectural advantages of Neo.mjs's persistent component model for moving stateful DOM elements, a common challenge for single-threaded frameworks.
