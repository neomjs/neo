# Create Deep-Dive Blog Post for Performance & Security

## 1. Goal
Create a detailed blog post explaining the performance and security enhancements in v10.

## 2. Target Audience
Senior engineers, tech leads, and teams for whom performance and security are critical.

## 3. Key Talking Points
- **Title Idea:** *Why Neo.mjs is Fast and Secure by Default*
- **Concepts:**
    - `useDomApiRenderer` and the move away from string-based rendering.
    - The VDOM update orchestrator and batched, surgical updates.
    - Built-in XSS protection by defaulting to `.text`.

## 4. Deliverable
A complete draft of the blog post as a markdown file.
