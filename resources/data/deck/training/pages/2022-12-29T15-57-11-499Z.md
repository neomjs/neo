A basic debugging (and coding!) task is getting a referernce to a component. 
You can then see the component's state and run its methods.

There are a few ways to get a component reference.
- `Neo.manager.Component.items` <tt>// Returns [Component]</tt>
- `Neo.find({property:'value'})` <tt>// Returns [{}] of instances<t/t>
- `Neo.findFirst({property:'value'})` <tt>// Returns first instance</tt>
