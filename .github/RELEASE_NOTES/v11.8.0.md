# Neo.mjs v11.8.0 Release Notes

This release marks a pivotal shift in our AI strategy, transitioning Neo.mjs from a "Tool Use" architecture to a true **"Agent OS"**, inspired by Anthropic's [Code Execution pattern](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp). We have introduced a standalone, type-safe AI SDK (`ai/services.mjs`) that enables agents to import and execute framework services directly in Node.js. This "Thick Client" approach allows for complex, autonomous workflows—demonstrated by our new **Self-Healing Repository** proof of concept—where agents can monitor, plan, and fix bugs without human intervention.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🤖 The Agent OS: Code Execution & Safe SDK

-   **Standalone AI SDK:** We've decoupled our intelligent services (Knowledge Base, Memory Core, GitHub Workflow) from the MCP transport layer. Agents can now import `ai/services.mjs` to access these capabilities directly as a Node.js library. (Issue #7831, #7832)
-   **"TypeScript without TypeScript":** We achieved the holy grail of JavaScript development: robust type safety without a compilation step. By dynamically wrapping our SDK with Zod schemas generated from our OpenAPI specs, we enforce strict contracts at runtime. This preserves our **Zero-Build Dev Mode** and **Web Standards** philosophy—allowing agents (and humans) to script complex logic directly in the browser console or Node.js without setting up a TS toolchain. (Issue #7843)
-   **Self-Healing Repository:** A groundbreaking demo script (`ai/examples/self-healing.mjs`) that autonomously monitors GitHub for bugs, queries the codebase for context, formulates a plan, and proposes a fix—all in a single execution cycle. (Issue #7833)

### 📂 New Agent Examples

We've added a suite of examples to demonstrate the power of the new Agent OS SDK:

-   `ai/examples/self-healing.mjs`: The flagship autonomous maintenance demo.
-   `ai/examples/smart-search.mjs`: Demonstrates programmatically querying and filtering the Knowledge Base.
-   `ai/examples/db-backup.mjs`: Programmable database backup using the exposed SDK.
-   `ai/examples/db-restore.mjs`: Restoration utility for the Knowledge Base or Memory Core.
-   `ai/examples/test-safety.mjs`: A verification script proving our runtime type safety catches invalid inputs.

### ⚙️ Core Framework Optimizations

-   **Faster Builds:** The `highlight.js` build script now skips unnecessary regeneration if the target files exist, significantly speeding up the `buildAll` process. (Issue #7823)
-   **Robust App Initialization:** Fixed potential race conditions in the App worker by initializing `Neo.apps` maps early and optimizing window-specific events (`onVisibilityChange`, `onOrientationChange`) to use direct lookups. (Issue #7827)
-   **UUID Window IDs:** Moved from timestamp-based IDs to `crypto.randomUUID()` for robust, collision-free window identification. (Issue #7828)
-   **SSR Optimization:** The `Stylesheet` addon now intelligently skips FontAwesome and global theme loading during Server-Side Rendering to prevent redundant network requests. (Issue #7829)

### 🛡️ Robust AI Infrastructure

-   **Hybrid Database Lifecycle:** Refactored the database services to support External, Managed, and Shared modes without deadlocks. (Issue #7836)
-   **JSON Parsing Resilience:** The Session Service now gracefully handles and strips Markdown code blocks from LLM responses, ensuring reliable JSON parsing. (Issue #7825, #7826)
-   **Schema & Backup fixes:** Fixed schema validation errors in the `list_issues` tool and enabled programmable database backups via the SDK. (Issue #7839, #7841)
