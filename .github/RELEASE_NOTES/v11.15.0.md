# Neo.mjs v11.15.0 Release Notes

**Democratizing AI Tooling: Your App, Now with Superpowers.**

This release is about one thing: **Putting the same AI tools we use to build Neo.mjs directly into your hands.**

Until today, the powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that drive our development—managing GitHub workflows, indexing knowledge, and maintaining long-term memory—were exclusive to the main Neo.mjs repository.

With v11.15.0, we have bridged that gap. Now, every new application created with `npx neo-app @latest` comes equipped with a fully configured, production-ready AI ecosystem out of the box.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🚀 AI-Native Workspaces from Day One

We've completely overhauled the scaffolding infrastructure (`create-app`) to treat AI as a first-class citizen. When you run `npx neo-app @latest`, you're not just getting a web framework; you're getting an **AI-ready development environment**.

**What's Inside the Box?**
*   **Instant MCP Integration:** A pre-configured `.gemini/settings.json` file automatically wires up your workspace to local instances of our three core MCP servers:
    *   `neo.mjs-github-workflow`: Automate your own project management.
    *   `neo.mjs-knowledge-base`: Index your own app's code for semantic search.
    *   `neo.mjs-memory-core`: Give your agents persistent memory of your project context.
*   **Standalone Independence:** We fixed critical pathing issues to ensure your vector databases (ChromaDB) live in *your* project root, not hidden away in `node_modules`. Your data stays with your app.
*   **Ready-to-Run Scripts:** Your `package.json` now includes `ai:mcp-*` commands, letting you spin up your AI infrastructure immediately after `npm install`.

This proves that our MCP servers are not just internal tools—they are portable, reusable infrastructure for any Neo.mjs application.

### 🛡️ CLI Robustness & Input Sanitization

While preparing for this wider adoption, we hardened our command-line interfaces. We discovered that the `commander` library didn't automatically sanitize quoted inputs, leading to edge cases when users passed arguments like `-t "all"`.

We implemented a comprehensive `sanitizeInput` utility and applied it across **20+ build and tool scripts**. Whether you're building themes, generating SEO files, or running AI agents, the CLI is now more forgiving and predictable.

## 🧪 We Want Your Feedback!

This is a major step in our vision of an **Agent Operating System**. We are effectively "exporting" our internal AI workflow to you.

**We need you to try it:**

1.  **Create a new workspace:**
    ```bash
    npx neo-app@latest
    ```
2.  **Configure your AI tooling keys (optional for Neo.mjs itself):** Create a `.env` file in your workspace root with your `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GH_TOKEN`. These are only required if you plan to use the AI tooling; Neo.mjs apps run perfectly fine without them.
3.  **Spin it up:** Open the project in an MCP-aware IDE (like Cursor or Windsurf) or connect your own agent.

**Does it feel magic? Does it break?**
Open an issue and let us know. We are building this future together.
