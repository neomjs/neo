## Understanding Layouts in Neo.mjs

Layouts are fundamental to arranging components within your application's user interface. In Neo.mjs, layouts are
managed declaratively through the `layout` configuration property of container components. This system provides a
powerful and flexible way to control the positioning, sizing, and alignment of child components.

### How Layouts Work

Every container component (any class extending `Neo.container.Base`) can have a `layout` config. This config defines
how the container's `items` (its child components) are arranged. When you set a `layout` on a container, the framework
automatically handles the positioning and sizing of its children, adapting to different screen sizes and dynamic content.

### The `layout` Config

The `layout` config is an object that typically includes an `ntype` property, specifying the type of layout to use.
Depending on the `ntype`, additional properties can be provided to customize the layout's behavior.

Example:

```javascript
layout: {
    ntype: 'vbox',
    align: 'center'
}
```

### The 'base' Layout (`ntype: 'base'`)

In scenarios where you prefer to manage the positioning and sizing of child components entirely through custom CSS or
in-line styles, you can use the `'base'` layout. This layout type provides minimal interference, essentially acting as a
pass-through, allowing you full control over the styling of your container's children.

When `ntype: 'base'` is used, the container will not apply any specific flexbox or grid-based layout rules to its children.
This is useful for highly customized components or when integrating with external styling libraries.

### Common Layout Types

Neo.mjs provides several built-in layout types to cover a wide range of UI design needs. Here, we'll explore some of the
most commonly used ones.

#### 1. VBox Layout (`ntype: 'vbox'`)

The VBox (Vertical Box) layout arranges child components in a single vertical column. It's ideal for creating stacked
sections or forms where elements flow from top to bottom.

**Key Properties for VBox Layouts:**

-   `align`: Controls the horizontal alignment of items within the column.
    -   `'left'` (default): Aligns items to the left.
    -   `'center'`: Centers items horizontally.
    -   `'right'`: Aligns items to the right.
    -   `'stretch'`: Stretches items to fill the available width of the container.

-   `pack`: Controls how items are packed along the vertical axis (main axis).
    -   `'start'` (default): Items are packed towards the top.
    -   `'center'`: Items are centered vertically.
    -   `'end'`: Items are packed towards the bottom.
    -   `'space-between'`: Items are evenly distributed with space between them.
    -   `'space-around'`: Items are evenly distributed with space around them (including half-space at ends).

-   `flex`: A property applied to individual child items, not the layout itself. It determines how an item grows or
    shrinks to fill available space within the VBox. A `flex` value of `1` means the item will expand to fill remaining
    space.

**Example:**

```javascript live-preview
import Container from '../container/Base.mjs';
import Button from '../button/Base.mjs';

class VBoxExample extends Container {
    static config = {
        className: 'Example.view.VBoxExample',
        layout: {
            ntype: 'vbox',
            align: 'center', // Center items horizontally
            pack: 'center'   // Center items vertically
        },
        items: [{
            module: Button,
            text: 'Button 1',
            width: 100
        }, {
            module: Button,
            text: 'Button 2',
            width: 150
        }, {
            module: Button,
            text: 'Button 3',
            flex: 1 // This button will expand to fill remaining vertical space
        }]
    }
}

Neo.setupClass(VBoxExample);
```

#### 2. HBox Layout (`ntype: 'hbox'`)

The HBox (Horizontal Box) layout arranges child components in a single horizontal row. It's commonly used for toolbars,
navigation menus, or any scenario where elements need to be displayed side-by-side.

**Key Properties for HBox Layouts:**

-   `align`: Controls the vertical alignment of items within the row.
    -   `'top'` (default): Aligns items to the top.
    -   `'center'`: Centers items vertically.
    -   `'bottom'`: Aligns items to the bottom.
    -   `'stretch'`: Stretches items to fill the available height of the container.

-   `pack`: Controls how items are packed along the horizontal axis (main axis).
    -   `'start'` (default): Items are packed towards the left.
    -   `'center'`: Items are centered horizontally.
    -   `'end'`: Items are packed towards the right.
    -   `'space-between'`: Items are evenly distributed with space between them.
    -   `'space-around'`: Items are evenly distributed with space around them (including half-space at ends).

-   `flex`: Similar to VBox, `flex` applied to individual child items determines how they grow or shrink to fill
    available horizontal space within the HBox.

**Example:**

```javascript live-preview
import Container from '../container/Base.mjs';
import Button from '../button/Base.mjs';

class HBoxExample extends Container {
    static config = {
        className: 'Example.view.HBoxExample',
        layout: {
            ntype: 'hbox',
            align: 'center', // Center items vertically
            pack: 'start'    // Pack items to the left
        },
        items: [{
            module: Button,
            text: 'Button A',
            height: 50
        }, {
            module: Button,
            text: 'Button B',
            height: 70
        }, {
            module: Button,
            text: 'Button C',
            flex: 1 // This button will expand to fill remaining horizontal space
        }]
    }
}

Neo.setupClass(HBoxExample);
```

#### 3. Card Layout (`ntype: 'card'`)

The Card layout is designed to display one child component at a time, making it ideal for tab panels, wizards, or any
interface where content needs to be switched without navigating away. Only the active card is visible, while others are
hidden.

**Key Properties for Card Layouts:**

-   `activeIndex_`: This is the most important config. Changing its value activates a different child component (card).
    The framework automatically handles showing the new card and hiding the old one.

-   `removeInactiveCards`: A boolean (default `true`). If `true`, the DOM elements of inactive cards are removed from the
    document flow, keeping only their instances and VDOM trees. This is useful for performance, especially with many
    cards, as it reduces the number of elements the browser has to render. If `false`, inactive cards remain in the DOM
    but are hidden via CSS.

-   `slideDirection_`: A string (`'horizontal'`, `'vertical'`, or `null` - default `null`). This property enables
    animated transitions when switching between cards. Setting it to `'horizontal'` or `'vertical'` will make the cards
    slide into view.

**Example:**

```javascript live-preview
import Container from '../container/Base.mjs';
import Button from '../button/Base.mjs';

class CardExample extends Container {
    static config = {
        className: 'Example.view.CardExample',
        layout: {
            ntype: 'card',
            activeIndex: 0 // Start with the first card active
        },
        items: [{
            module: Container,
            cls: 'card-panel',
            items: [{
                module: Button,
                text: 'Go to Card 2',
                handler: function() {
                    this.up('container').layout.activeIndex = 1;
                }
            }],
            style: {
                backgroundColor: '#e0f7fa',
                padding: '20px',
                textAlign: 'center'
            }
        }, {
            module: Container,
            cls: 'card-panel',
            items: [{
                module: Button,
                text: 'Go to Card 1',
                handler: function() {
                    this.up('container').layout.activeIndex = 0;
                }
            }],
            style: {
                backgroundColor: '#fff3e0',
                padding: '20px',
                textAlign: 'center'
            }
        }]
    }
}

Neo.setupClass(CardExample);
