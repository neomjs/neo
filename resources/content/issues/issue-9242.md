# Expand DevIndex Spider Engine Guide with Workflow Steps

- Expand `learn/guides/devindex/spider/Engine.md` to include a "Discovery Workflow: Step-by-Step" section.
- Explicitly document the 6 execution steps (State Loading, Strategy Selection, Execution, Extraction, Filtering, Persistence).
- Embed relevant code snippets from `Spider.mjs` for each step to ground the documentation in the code.
- Add a focused Mermaid diagram detailing the "Extraction & Filtering" decision tree.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have expanded the `Engine.md` guide. I added the new "Discovery Workflow: Step-by-Step" section, explicitly covering the 6 execution steps with corresponding code snippets from `Spider.mjs`. I also included a new Mermaid flowchart focusing specifically on the Extraction & Filtering logic. The changes have been pushed. Closing issue.
