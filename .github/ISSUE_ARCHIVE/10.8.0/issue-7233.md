# Create Blog Post for AI-Native Platform Launch

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-09-22

## 1. Overview

To drive engagement and attract new contributors, a blog post is needed to announce and explain the new AI-native architecture introduced in recent releases (v10.6.0, v10.7.0). The post should generate excitement around these new capabilities and serve as a key piece of content for the upcoming Hacktoberfest event.

## 2. Scope of Work

-   **Draft Initial Blog Post:** Create a new markdown file in `learn/blog/` for the announcement.
-   **High-Level Content:** The post should cover the core concepts of the AI-native platform, including the local knowledge base and the `AGENTS.md` protocol.
-   **Target Audience:** The content should be accessible to developers unfamiliar with Neo.mjs, highlighting the benefits to the developer experience.
-   **Call to Action:** The post must include a strong call to action encouraging readers to explore the features and participate in Hacktoberfest.

*Note: This ticket covers the initial draft. The content will be refined and enhanced extensively before publication.*

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

-   A new blog post file is created in the `learn/blog/` directory.
-   The initial draft covers the key topics at a high level.
-   The post is ready for subsequent review and detailed content enhancement.
