# Epic: Draft and Finalize v12.0.0 Release Notes

This epic tracks the creation of the Neo.mjs v12.0.0 release notes. 
We have approximately 400 tickets in scope, representing a massive month of velocity and architectural evolution.

This epic will be broken down into focused sub-tickets to manage the scope, extract technical narratives, and ensure a high-quality final document.
