# Docs: Add guide for troubleshooting tool calls

This ticket is for adding a new guide to the learning section on how to troubleshoot tool calls for AI agents.

The guide is based on a real-world scenario where a model failed to use a tool correctly, and another model succeeded by using a more flexible, trial-and-error approach.

The new guide is located at `learn/guides/ai/TroubleshootingToolCalls.md` and is already added to the `learn/tree.json`.
