This is a new paradigm. If you want to enter a new era of making better Web Based User Interfaces,
the following concepts will be addictive.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>What if ...</th>
        <th>Benefit</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1.</td>
        <td>... a framework & all the apps you build are running inside a separate thread (web worker)?</td>
        <td>You get extreme Performance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2.</td>
        <td>... the main thread would be mostly idle, only applying the real dom manipulations,
            so there are no background tasks slowing it down?</td>
        <td>You get extreme UI responsiveness</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3.</td>
        <td>... a framework was fully build on top of ES8, but can run inside multiple workers without any Javascript builds?</td>
        <td>Your development speed will increase</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4.</td>
        <td>... you don’t need source-maps to debug your code, since you do get the real code 1:1?</td>
        <td>You get a smoother Debugging Experience</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5.</td>
        <td>... you don’t have to use string based pseudo XML templates ever again?</td>
        <td>You get unreached simplicity, no more scoping nightmares</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6.</td>
        <td>... you don’t have to use any sort of templates at all, ever again?</td>
        <td>You gain full control!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>7.</td>
        <td>... you can use persistent JSON structures instead?</td>
        <td>You gain more simplicity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>8.</td>
        <td>... there is a custom virtual dom engine in place, which is so fast,
            that it will change your mind about the performance of web based user interfaces?</td>
        <td>You get extreme performance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>9.</td>
        <td>... the ES8 class system gets enhanced with a custom config system,
            making it easier to extend and work with config driven design patterns?</td>
        <td>Extensibility, a robust base for solid UI architectures</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>10.</td>
        <td>... your user interfaces can truly scale?</td>
        <td>You get extreme Performance</td>
    </tr>

### The webworkers driven UI framework

Prior to the public release, the project was already at <a href=".github/NEOMJS_HISTORY.md">3720 commits</a>.

Please take a look at the <a href=".github/GETTING_STARTED.md">Getting Started Guide</a>.

Although neo.mjs is ready to craft beautiful & blazing fast UIs, the current state is just a fraction of a bigger
picture.<br/>
Take a look at the <a href=".github/VISION.md">Project Story & Vision</a>.
