**Core Architecture & Multi-Window Precision**

This release is a powerhouse, resolving **107 tickets** in just over two weeks. From a sheer scope perspective—introducing a new flagship app, overhauling the core rendering engine, and redefining multi-window architecture—this could easily justify a major version bump.

However, we are sticking to **v11.17.0**. Why? Because we have even bigger plans for v12. Consider this the "final form" of the v11 series: a highly polished, performant foundation that sets the stage for the next evolutionary leap.

This update focuses on deep architectural precision. We have **consolidated the Main thread's queue system**, moving from a triple Read-Write-Update model to a streamlined Read-Write model for better batching efficiency.

Crucially, we have enhanced the **VDOM & VNode architecture** to treat scroll state (`scrollTop`, `scrollLeft`) as first-class properties. This allows us to capture and restore scroll positions seamlessly across all rendering modes—**DomApiRenderer**, **StringBasedRenderer**, and even **SSR** scenarios via new post-update queues.

These capabilities necessitated a fundamental shift in our multi-window architecture. We have deprecated the ambiguous `'main'` destination for worker messages, **enforcing explicit `windowId` routing** to ensure precision in multi-window applications. Consequently, **all remote methods** have been refactored to explicitly pass `windowId`, eliminating ambiguity when communicating through the main thread.

Furthermore, we are solidifying the **AgentOS** ecosystem with the introduction of the **Legit** app (a dedicated Git GUI) and significant upgrades to the Dashboard.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🚀 Legit: A Neo.mjs Implementation
We are excited to showcase a new demo application developed in cooperation with **Martin**, founder of the **Legit** open-source project.

*   **The Project:** Legit is an innovative, standalone OSS Git client. This demo represents a port of its core concepts into the Neo.mjs ecosystem, validating our platform's capability to handle complex, desktop-grade development tools.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   **Service Layer (`Legit.service.Legit`):** A robust singleton service that abstracts a **virtual file system** (using `memfs`) and **Git operations** (using `@legit-sdk/core`). It handles file seeding, hashing (SHA-1), and tree traversal entirely within the App Worker, ensuring heavy I/O and cryptographic operations never block the UI.
    *   **Reactive Polling:** The `ViewportController` implements a smart polling mechanism that monitors the virtual Git `HEAD`. When changes are detected, it calculates a **Tree Delta** (added, modified, deleted files) and efficiently updates the `FileStore` and `CommitStore` in real-time.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Live Preview Editor:** Integrated **Monaco Editor** (via `LivePreview`) that supports both Markdown and Neo.mjs code editing with instant visual feedback.
    *   **Commit History Grid:** A virtualized `Neo.grid.Container` visualizing the repository history, bound directly to the `CommitStore`.
    *   **Virtual File Tree:** A `TreeList` navigation component that dynamically reflects the state of the in-memory Git repository.

### ⚛️ Core Refactoring: Architectural Precision
We performed a massive, deep-dive refactoring of the core rendering pipeline and worker architecture. These changes eliminate race conditions, reduce memory overhead, and ensure buttery-smooth performance.

*   **Rendering Pipeline:**
    *   **Unified Update Strategy:** We merged the manual DOM update path (`App.applyDeltas`) with the VDOM update pipeline. Both now use a standardized `updateVdom` action, ensuring consistent `requestAnimationFrame` synchronization across the board.
    *   **Read/Write Queues:** The Main thread (`Neo.Main`) now strictly enforces a consolidated **Read/Write** queue model, replacing the legacy triple-queue system. This maximizes DOM batching efficiency.
    *   **Zero-Delta Optimization:** `Neo.worker.Manager` now intelligently intercepts and drops "empty" updates before they needlessly occupy the main thread.
    *   **AutoMount as Delta:** The "magic" `autoMount` process has been transformed into a standard `insertNode` delta operation, unifying the mounting logic.
    *   **Mount Refactor:** `mount()` is now a direct, lightweight alias for `initVnode(true)`, removing the legacy `VdomLifecycle` overhead for unmounted components.

*   **State & Scroll Management:**
    *   **Save Scroll Position:** `scrollTop` and `scrollLeft` are now first-class citizens in the VNode structure. This allows scroll state to be captured live (`onScrollCapture`) and **automatically restored** when components are moved or re-mounted (e.g., during drag-and-drop or tab switching).
    *   **Grid Scroll Sync:** Fixed a critical race condition in Buffered Grids by enforcing bidirectional synchronization of scroll state between the Main thread and VDOM worker.

*   **Architecture & Memory:**
    *   **Explicit Window IDs:** We are migrating away from the ambiguous `'main'` destination string. Cross-worker communication now prioritizes explicit `windowId` routing, essential for robust Multi-Window applications.
    *   **Async Remote Registration:** Remote method registration (`promiseRemotes`) is now fully asynchronous and deterministic, eliminating race conditions during application startup.
    *   **Symbol-Based Store Sorting:** Refactored `Neo.data.Store` to use a lightweight `initialIndexSymbol` for tracking insertion order. This removes the need to duplicate the entire dataset for state restoration, significantly reducing memory usage for large stores.

### 🧩 SortZone & Dashboard Polish: Advanced "Drag-to-Popup"
The multi-window drag-and-drop experience has evolved from a basic functional capability into a sophisticated, native-grade interaction model. This release solves several hard technical problems to ensure that dragging complex, stateful components (like 3D Canvases or Iframes) feels seamless.

*   **Live Component Dragging (Manual DOM Strategy):**
    *   Previously, dragging a component involved moving it in the VDOM, which triggered a destroy/re-create cycle for the underlying DOM node. This would reset stateful elements (e.g., reloading an iframe or killing a canvas context).
    *   **The Fix:** We implemented a **Manual DOM Delta** strategy. The framework now surgically moves the *actual* DOM node into the Drag Proxy without disturbing the VDOM structure until the drop is finalized. This allows `OffscreenCanvas` and `Iframe` components to remain "live" and interactive even while being dragged.

*   **Intelligent Layout Transitions ("Fill the Gap"):**
    *   **Window Detachment:** When a widget is dragged outside the dashboard boundary, `SortZone` now calculates a "Target Layout" for the remaining items. It mathematically infers gaps and padding from the DOM snapshot and smoothly animates the siblings to fill the void left by the detached component.
    *   **Seamless Re-entry:** Dragging the window back over the dashboard instantly snaps the layout back to its "sortable" state, restoring the gap and showing the drag placeholder exactly where the item would land.

*   **Robust Window Management:**
    *   **Exact Sizing:** We resolved a complex race condition where browser chrome (headers/toolbars) caused popup windows to resize unpredictably. The new logic enforces "Outer Height" locking, ensuring the popup window appears with the exact same dimensions as the dragged item.
    *   **Auto-Stealing:** Components robustly "steal" ownership of themselves when moving between contexts (Dashboard -> Drag Proxy -> Window -> Dashboard), preventing state corruption.

*   **Logical Component Bubbling:**
    *   We refactored the Event Manager to support **Logical Ancestry**. Even when a component is physically detached from the DOM (e.g., inside a floating Drag Proxy or a different Window), events still bubble up to its *logical* parent container. This ensures that Controllers listening on the Dashboard continue to receive events from the dragged item seamlessly.

*   **Refactoring:** Renamed `container.sortable` to `container.dragResortable` to unambiguously distinguish item reordering from data sorting (e.g., in Grids).

### 🖥️ Multi-Window Architecture: Explicit Window IDs
We have deprecated the generic `'main'` destination for cross-window messaging.
*   **Explicit Addressing:** The architecture now enforces explicit Window IDs for all remote method calls and state propagation. This eliminates ambiguity in multi-window apps where "main" could refer to the opener or the current context.
*   **Canvas Migration:** `OffscreenCanvas` nodes can now be transferred between windows (SharedWorkers) without losing their state or context, enabling seamless 3D/2D visualization portability.

### 📝 LivePreview: The "Inception" Architecture
The `code.LivePreview` component—the heart of our docs and interactive examples—has been reimagined from a simple code runner into a **recursive development environment**.

*   **Polymorphic Rendering:** The component now seamlessly switches between `neomjs` (code execution) and `markdown` (rich text) modes. It uses a new pluggable executor system (`src/code/executor/Neo.mjs`) to handle the specifics of each language.
*   **The "Inception" Capability:** This is the game-changer. `Neo.component.Markdown` doesn't just parse text; it **hydrates applications**.
    *   A Markdown file can contain a ````javascript live-preview```` block.
    *   The renderer detects this and instantiates a *real* `Neo.code.LivePreview` component inside the document flow.
    *   **Recursion:** That nested LivePreview can, in turn, load another Markdown file, which contains more LivePreviews.
    *   This allows for incredibly rich, interactive documentation where examples are fully functional applications running inside the document flow.
*   **Self-Sufficient Window Management:**
    *   `LivePreview` now manages its own "pop-out" lifecycle using the new **Explicit Window ID** architecture.
    *   **Recursive Popping:** You can pop a preview out to a new window. Inside that new window, you can interact with a nested example and pop *that* out to a *third* window. The component propagates its environment (`windowUrl`, `windowId`) down the tree, ensuring every child app behaves correctly regardless of its nesting level.
*   **Neo.component.Markdown:** A new first-class component that encapsulates `marked.js` parsing, `HighlightJS` syntax highlighting, and the component hydration logic. It replaces the ad-hoc HTML injection used previously, providing a stable foundation for content-driven apps.
