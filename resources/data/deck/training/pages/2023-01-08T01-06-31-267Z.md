#Introduction

In this lab you'll add a couple of event handlers.

#Steps

??Add a listener to a table event

Tables fire a _select_ event, passing an object that contains a
reference to the corresponding row.

Add this table config:

    listeners: {
        select: (data) => {
            console.log(data.record);
        }
    }

Save and refresh, then click on a table row. If you look at the 
debugger console you'll see the record being logged.

Just for fun, expand the logged value and look for the _size_ property.
If you recall, that's a value from the feed, and one of the things we
configured in the store's `fields:[]`.

In the console, click on the ellipses by _size_ and enter a new value, like
_2.5_. (Don't enter a larger value, or you may destroy that part of Iceland.)

After changing the value you should immediately see it reflected in the table row.

??Add a listener to a map event

Now add a _markerClick_ listener to the Google Map.

    listeners: {
        markerClick: data => {
            console.log(data.data.record); 
        }
    },
