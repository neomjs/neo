# Create DevIndex Guide: Talent Scouts & Recruiters

**Objective:** Create a guide targeting recruiters to shift the perception of DevIndex from "data scraper" to "career enablement platform."
**Key Points:**
- How to use the `Hireable` filter effectively.
- How to interpret the "Cyborg Metrics" (Velocity, Acceleration, Consistency).
- Emphasize the value of the Consistency badge (🏛️) to find "10x" or "100x" developers who have been quietly and reliably contributing for 10+ years, proving that such elite performance profiles are not a myth.
- Note the v1 limitation regarding location (filtering is limited to Country ISO codes, not specific cities, due to the free-form nature of GitHub's location field).
