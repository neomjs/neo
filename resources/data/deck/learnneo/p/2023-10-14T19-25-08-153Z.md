The purpose of this tutorial is to let you see the structure of a Neo.mjs workspace,
and the structure of an application.

If you wish, you can create a workspace for yourself by running `npx neo-app` workspace.

As you can see, a Neo.mjs workspace is a conventional npm package. If you run 
the script `npm run server-start` from the workspace, Neo.mjs launches a web
server whose doc root is the workspace.

If you drill down into the `src` directory you'll see your applications.
The `docs` directory holds the Neo.mjs API docs.

In order to discuss the structure of an app, we'll create a simple starter 
app vis this script, run from the workspace. The script prompts for various 
application settings. 

`npm run create-app-empty`

At the first prompt, we'll name the app `Foo`, and accept the default for everything else.
The script creates an application structured as follows.

These files are part of the typical structure of a Neo.mjs application. The files `index.html`, `app.mjs`, `neo-config.json`, `view/Viewport.mjs` are rarely modified.
You will, however, edit the main container, and its associated "controller" and "model",
as well as create new views classes, their controllers, and other application logic.

Now let's look at a source file. This is the contents of `MainView.mjs`.

<pre data-javascript>
import Container  from '../../../node_modules/neo.mjs/src/container/Base.mjs';
import Controller from './MainViewController.mjs';
import ViewModel  from './MainViewModel.mjs';

class MainView extends Container {
    static config = {
        className : 'Foo.view.MainView',
        controller: Controller,
        model     : ViewModel,
        layout    : {ntype: 'fit'},
        items     : []
    }
}

Neo.applyClassConfig(MainView);

export default MainView;
</pre>

Neo.mjs views are composed of components. A component can be a "container", which means it
visually holds or groups other components, or a regular component, like a button. The main
view is a container, which you can see because `MainView extends Base`, and `Base` is 
the container base class. The items in a container are configured in the `items:[]`, which
is empty in this starter code.

This view also has a "controller" and "model". We'll talk about those later, but in a nutshell,
a controller is where event handling and app logic goes, and a model is where you set up shared
bindable data.

We'll go into a lot more depth about view, controllers, and models in other topics, but to let
you see how a component is configured let's put a button in the container. 

First, we need to import the class that defines buttons. Then we'll describe the new button in the
`items:[].`

<pre data-javascript>
import Button     from '../../../node_modules/neo.mjs/src/button/Base.mjs';
import Container  from '../../../node_modules/neo.mjs/src/container/Base.mjs';
import Controller from './MainViewController.mjs';
import ViewModel  from './MainViewModel.mjs';

class MainView extends Container {
    static config = {
        className : 'Foo.view.MainView',
        controller: Controller,
        model     : ViewModel,
        layout: {ntype:'vbox', align:'start'}, 
        items : [{
            module: Button,
            text  : 'Button'
        }]
    }
}

Neo.applyClassConfig(MainView);

export default MainView;
</pre>


Note the entry in `items:[]`. That's a description of the button that will be the single item in our 
container. In Neo.mjs terms we're _configuring_ the button. Neo.mjs is a declarative framework, in 
which components and objects are described. It's an abstraction. In other words, the code describes 
what we want, but not how it's done. In the code above, we want our container to have one item &mdash; 
a button with some text. _How_ that's done isn't important. A non-declarative approach would be more
focused on _how_, where you might way "I want a &lt;button> HTML element with its innerHTML set to 
some value." 

In another topic you'll learn about the Neo.mjs config system and declaratively describing views, 
controllers, and other things.

Here's a simplified running example. The `model` and `controller` are omitted, because they aren't 
actually used in the example, and the import root path is different to reflect the location of the 
Neo.mjs libarary relative to the examples.

<pre data-neo>
import Base from '../../../../src/container/Base.mjs';
import Button from '../../../../src/button/Base.mjs';
import Split from '../../../../src/button/Split.mjs';
class MainView extends Base {
    static config = {
        className : 'Example.view.MainView',
        layout: {ntype:'vbox', align:'start'},
        items : [{
            module: Button,
            text  : 'Button'
        }]
    }
}
Neo.applyClassConfig(MainView);
</pre>
