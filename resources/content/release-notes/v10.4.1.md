# Neo.mjs v10.4.1 Release Notes

## Highlights

This patch release polishes the "instant preview" feature for grids introduced in v10.4.0, ensuring the grid's scrollbar and accessibility properties are correctly sized from the very first paint when loading large datasets. The non-buffered `table.Body` also receives a major performance boost for clearing data.

## Enhancements & Bug Fixes

### 1. Polished "Instant Preview" for Large Datasets in Grids
The chunked loading mechanism for stores and grids has been refined. When adding a large dataset, the initial `load` event now carries the final total record count. The `grid.Container` uses this information immediately to set the correct `aria-rowcount` and to size the vertical scrollbar accurately, preventing layout shifts and providing a more stable and accessible user experience from the very first render.

### 2. Standardized Internal Store `load` Event
To support the "instant preview" refinements, the `data.Store` `load` event payload has been standardized internally. It now consistently uses an object containing an `items` property (e.g., `{items: [...]}`). Framework components have been updated to use this new signature.

### 3. Performance Fast Path for `table.Body`
The non-buffered `table.Body` is now significantly faster when clearing its data. It uses the same "fast path" optimization as `grid.Body`, directly clearing the DOM instead of processing a large and unnecessary VDOM diff when an empty dataset is loaded. This aligns the performance of the two components.
