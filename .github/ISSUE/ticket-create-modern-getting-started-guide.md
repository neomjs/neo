# Ticket: Create a Modern 'Getting Started' Guide

## Description

The current `learn/gettingstarted/Workspaces.md` guide is outdated and relies heavily on images, which are not accessible to AI tools or screen readers. 

The goal of this ticket is to create a new, modern guide in the `learn/gettingstarted/` folder to replace it.

### Tasks:

1.  Create a new markdown file (e.g., `learn/gettingstarted/CreatingYourFirstApp.md`).
2.  Write a text-based tutorial that walks a new user through the `npx neo-app` command.
3.  Describe the modern workspace and application folder structure.
4.  Explain the purpose of the key files in a minimal app (`app.mjs`, `MainView.mjs`, etc.).
5.  Ensure all code examples are in text-based, copy-pastable code blocks.
