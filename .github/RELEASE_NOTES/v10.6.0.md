# Neo.mjs v10.6.0 Release Notes

## Highlights

This release introduces a powerful new AI Knowledge Base for the Neo.mjs repository, significantly improves the Dashboard Drag & Drop functionality, and adds a new Window Management permission request.

## New: AI Knowledge Base

We are excited to introduce a local AI Knowledge Base, a new feature that allows developers to interact with the Neo.mjs codebase and documentation in a conversational way. This is especially powerful for those using AI assistants like Gemini CLI or building custom agents.

Instead of manually searching through files, you can now ask questions directly and get answers based on the framework's source code, documentation, and blog posts. This can dramatically speed up development and learning.

Key features include:
- **Conversational Code Queries:** Ask questions about classes, methods, and configurations.
- **Comprehensive Content:** The knowledge base includes the framework's source code, JSDoc, markdown files and the Neo.mjs blog posts.
- **Local & Private:** Your data stays on your machine. It runs locally, using a local vector database (ChromaDB) and your own `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

This is the first iteration of the AI Knowledge Base, and we are excited to see how you use it. For more details on the implementation, see issue [#7214](https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/7214).

To get started, please follow the instructions in the **[.github/AI_QUICK_START.md](/.github/AI_QUICK_START.md)** guide.
