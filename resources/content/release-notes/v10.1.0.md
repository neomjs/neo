**Neo.mjs v10.1.0 Release Notes**

This release includes important fixes and minor improvements, primarily focusing on VDOM optimization, collection performance, and selection model improvements.

**Key Updates:**

*   **VDOM Optimization & `neo-ignore` Refinement (Addresses #7114):**
    The internal handling of the `neo-ignore` flag has been significantly improved. Previously, `neo-ignore` could interfere with the VDOM's structural integrity, potentially leading to rendering anomalies, **especially in complex layouts like grids, where elements might overlap**. Now, a dedicated `neoIgnore: true` flag is added to VDOM nodes, preserving the original `componentId` and `id`. This ensures the VDOM engine can correctly identify and skip sub-trees during diffing, leading to more robust and efficient asymmetric VDOM updates and resolving visual rendering issues **such as those observed in grid components**.

*   **Collection Performance Enhancements (Addresses #7115):**
    Several methods within `src/collection/Base.mjs` (e.g., `clear`, `findBy`, `pop`, `remove`) have been optimized by replacing `this.getCount()` method calls with direct access to `this.count`. This change streamlines collection operations, leading to improved performance.

*   **Enhanced Selection Model (Addresses #7116):**
    The `src/selection/Model.mjs` has been updated to provide more comprehensive data during selection changes. A new `getController()` method has been added, and the `selectionChange` event now includes the `records` array, offering richer context for selection handling and better integration with view controllers.

*   **Minor Fixes & Improvements (Addresses #7117):**
    This release also includes minor cleanups and documentation improvements, such as an updated JSDoc comment in `src/grid/Body.mjs` and the removal of a debug `console.log` statement in `src/main/DeltaUpdates.mjs`.
