# Create "Declarative VDOM with Effects" Guide

**Description:**

A new guide has been drafted and added to the `learn/guides/fundamentals/DeclarativeVDOMWithEffects.md` file, and its entry has been added to `learn/tree.json`.

This guide explains the new declarative VDOM pattern using `Neo.core.Effect`, contrasts it with the traditional imperative `afterSet` hook pattern, and demonstrates its extensibility through inheritance. It also provides guidance on when to use each approach.
