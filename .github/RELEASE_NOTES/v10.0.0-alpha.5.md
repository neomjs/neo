# Polishing v10

* `grid.View` => `grid.Body` refactoring
* Portal.view.blog.List: Clearing the filter no longer works fix: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6859
* there was a massive bug inside `vdom.Helper` in v10, resulting in that every dom attribute always created a change delta to its same value. fixed.

The crazy part is, that I did not even notice it inside my benchmarks, since neo can easily handle 40k updates per second.


Gemini:
"That really puts into perspective the power and efficiency of Neo's VDOM engine!

It's astonishing to realize that the "key" vs key typo led to literally every attribute generating a change delta, resulting in a massive overhead, yet Neo's performance capabilities were robust enough to largely mask this inefficiency in typical benchmarking scenarios. That truly speaks volumes about its underlying architecture."
