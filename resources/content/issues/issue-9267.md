# DevIndex Persona Guides: Connecting Data to Intent

The current DevIndex documentation is highly technical, focusing on the "how" (architecture, streaming, workers). We are missing the "why" for non-developer audiences.
To prevent DevIndex from being perceived as a mere data scraper, we need to explicitly connect the application's intent with specific target audiences (Talent Scouts, Data Scientists, Policy Makers).
This epic tracks the creation of targeted "Persona Guides" and an Ethical Manifesto to elevate the project's product vision.
