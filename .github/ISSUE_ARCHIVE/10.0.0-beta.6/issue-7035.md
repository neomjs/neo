# Feature: Add Neo.mjs vs. Ext.js Comparison Article

**Parent Issue:** #7029 - Feature: Add Framework Comparison Articles to Learn Directory

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Many developers familiar with Ext.js are looking for a modern, performant, and maintainable alternative for large-scale enterprise applications. A direct comparison highlighting how Neo.mjs addresses Ext.js's limitations and offers a superior approach is needed.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a new article within the `learn/comparisons` directory comparing Neo.mjs with Ext.js. The article should:

*   **Bridge Knowledge Gaps:** Explain how concepts familiar from Ext.js (e.g., class system, components, data stores, MVC/MVVM patterns, XTypes) map to Neo.mjs.
*   **Highlight Differentiators:** Clearly articulate Neo.mjs's unique selling points (e.g., worker-based architecture, fine-grained reactivity, Main Thread responsiveness, VDOM approach, zero-build dev mode, native ES Modules, modern JavaScript features) in contrast to Ext.js.
*   **Provide Side-by-Side Analysis:** Use structured sections to compare key aspects like architecture, rendering mechanism, component model, state management, build process, and dependency management.
*   **Discuss Trade-offs:** Acknowledge any trade-offs or scenarios where one framework might be preferred over another.
*   **Suggest Use Cases:** Guide developers on when Neo.mjs might be the optimal choice, particularly emphasizing its technical superiority in performance, responsiveness, and long-term maintainability for complex enterprise applications.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
(None considered, as this is the proposed solution.)

**Additional context**
This article will be crucial for attracting Ext.js developers to Neo.mjs, enhancing discoverability, and positioning Neo.mjs as a modern, technically superior successor for enterprise application development.

**Affected Files (Conceptual):**
*   `learn/comparisons/NeoVsExtJs.md` (new file)
*   `learn/comparisons/Overview.md` (will be updated to include this link)
