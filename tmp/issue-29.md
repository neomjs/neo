# Update README.md with AI tooling info and outdated content cleanup

Update `README.md` to reflect the project's current state and new AI features.

**Tasks:**
- Add a section explaining that AI MCP servers (GitHub Workflow, etc.) depend on the `neo.mjs` node module and require `npm install` to function.
- Update the "package.json Scripts" section to list and explain the new `ai:*` scripts.
- Review and remove/update severely outdated information (e.g., old screenshot references if broken, deprecated commands).
