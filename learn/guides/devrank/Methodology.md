# DevRank Methodology

## The Philosophy
DevRank aims to create a meritocratic index of the open-source ecosystem. Unlike other metrics that prioritize follower counts or star gazing, DevRank focuses on **Total Contribution Volume**.

## Scoring
Scoring is based on a weighted aggregate of:
1.  **Commits** (Primary metric)
2.  **Pull Requests** (Code, Review)
3.  **Issues** (Reporting, Discussion)
4.  **Code Reviews**
