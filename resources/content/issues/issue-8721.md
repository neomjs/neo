# ServicesCanvas Visualization: From 'Traffic' to 'Intelligence'

The `ServicesCanvas.mjs` component currently visualizes the Neo.mjs runtime as a "busy network" with exploding debris. This contradicts the new "Neural Link" and "Application Engine" branding, which emphasizes stability, intelligence, and construction.

This Epic tracks the transformation of the canvas into a visualization of an "Intelligent Application Engine".

**Sub-Tasks:**

1.  **Refactor Debris to Construction**
    *   Replace "Explosion" visuals with "Crystallization/Construction".
    *   Implies stability and engineering rather than destruction.

2.  **Upgrade Runners to Agents**
    *   Transform "Data Runners" into "Neural Agents".
    *   Agents should act with intent: stopping at nodes to "scan" or "patch" them, visualizing the Neural Link's active maintenance.

3.  **Visual Polish & Renaming**
    *   Rename "Lattice" to "Neural Fabric" in documentation.
    *   Ensure strict adherence to the Blue-Scale brand palette.
