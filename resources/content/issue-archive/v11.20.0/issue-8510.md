# Enhance JSDoc for Ticket and Release Index Build Scripts

Apply the Knowledge Base Enhancement Strategy to `buildScripts/createTicketIndex.mjs` and `buildScripts/createReleaseIndex.mjs`.

**Scope:**
1.  **Module-Level Documentation:** Add comprehensive JSDoc headers to both files explaining their role in the Portal application's data pipeline.
2.  **Method Documentation:** Enhance JSDoc for `createTicketIndex`, `createReleaseIndex`, and their respective `runCli` functions.
3.  **Semantic Signposts:** Include relevant keywords (e.g., `SEO`, `Portal`, `JSON Index`, `Static Data`) to aid AI discovery.

**Goal:**
Make these critical build scripts self-documenting and easily discoverable by future AI sessions.
