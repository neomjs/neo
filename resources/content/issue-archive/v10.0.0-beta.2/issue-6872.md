# Portal App: Examples ordering

* While "Liquid Glass effect" is a fun demo, it wrecks your GPU and heats up your device.
* Especially on non high end devices, it can mislead users to assume the performance is related to neo, which is not the case.
* Having it at the top of the list distracts from the really important examples.
* Moving it far to the bottom.
