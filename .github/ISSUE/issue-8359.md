# Refine Portal FAQ Schema metaphors for SEO

Refine the "Toyota vs F1" metaphor in the Portal's FAQ schema to be more explicit (using "like a...") to ensure clarity in search engine snippets where context is missing.

**Change:**
*   From: "Traditional frameworks (Toyota) are libraries..."
*   To: "Traditional frameworks are general-purpose libraries (like a Toyota)..."
