# Ticket: Rewrite Project Vision (`VISION.md`)

GH ticket id: #7265

**Assignee:**
**Status:** To Do

**Parent Epic:** epic-enhance-workflow-with-planning-phase.md

## Description

The current `.github/VISION.md` file is outdated and no longer reflects the project's forward-looking goals. This task is to rewrite the content to create a clear, modern, and inspiring vision for the Neo.mjs framework.

This updated vision will serve as the foundational document for all strategic planning and will be referenced by the future `ROADMAP.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The content of `.github/VISION.md` is completely replaced with a new vision statement.
2.  The new vision should clearly articulate:
    *   The core problem Neo.mjs solves.
    *   Its unique value proposition and key differentiators.
    *   The long-term goals and direction of the project.
