## Description

To ensure that human and AI developers can successfully set up and use the Chrome DevTools Model Context Protocol (MCP)
server, a new guide needs to be created. This guide will live in `learn/guides/ai/` and will provide clear instructions
for installation and troubleshooting.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new markdown file is created at `learn/guides/ai/ChromeDevToolsMcpServer.md`.
2.  The guide explains the purpose of the MCP server.
3.  The guide explicitly states that Node.js v22.12.0 or higher is a strict requirement.
4.  The guide explains how the MCP server is configured in `.gemini/settings.json`.
5.  The guide provides basic troubleshooting steps, including how to check the server status and log files.
