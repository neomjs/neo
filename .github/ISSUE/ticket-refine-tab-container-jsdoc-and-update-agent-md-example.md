# Ticket: Refine tab.Container JSDoc and Update AGENT.md Example

GH ticket id: #7309

**Assignee:** Gemini
**Status:** Done

## Description
The JSDoc for `Neo.tab.Container` is minimal. It needs to be enhanced with intent-driven comments explaining its architecture, its composition of a header toolbar and a body container, and its role in managing tabbed content.

Once the new JSDoc is in place, the hypothetical example in `.github/AGENTS.md` (lines 162-180) should be replaced with this new, accurate, and real-world JSDoc block to improve the quality of the agent guidelines.
