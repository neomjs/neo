# Ticket: Generate sitemap.xml File via Build Script

GH ticket id: #7451

**Assignee:** tobiu
**Status:** To Do

**Parent Epic:** epic-enhance-neo-website-seo.md
**Depends On:** ticket-create-sitemap-generator-script.md

## Description

A `sitemap.xml` file is essential for telling search engines which pages on our site are available for crawling. This file will be automatically generated by a build script to ensure it is always accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Enhance the `buildScripts/generate-seo-files.mjs` script.
2.  Add a function to the script that takes the parsed list of content URLs and formats them into the standard `sitemap.xml` format.
3.  The script should write the final XML output to a new `sitemap.xml` file in the `apps/portal/` directory.
4.  The task of submitting the sitemap to search consoles will be handled separately after generation is complete.
