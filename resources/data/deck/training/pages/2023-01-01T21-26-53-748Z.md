Earlier, we made a big deal about how Neo components were _declarative_ â€” where
the code is an abstraction that _describes_ what's being created.

But the code has some procedural code. 

There's _was_ some procedural in the store's fields[], but we moved that into
a separate view model class.

But the event handlers are in the main container. In a normal app you'd have
a lot of event listeners with a lot of business logic in them. Except for the
most trivial use cases, you don't want that logic in your views.
