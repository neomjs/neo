# Epic: 'Sighted' Agent - Chrome DevTools Integration

GH ticket id: #7385

**Assignee:** tobiu
**Status:** To Do

## Scope

This epic covers the integration of the Chrome DevTools Model Context Protocol (MCP) server into the neo.mjs development workflow. The primary goal is to give the AI agent 'sight' by allowing it to programmatically interact with a live browser instance. This will enable the agent to verify UI changes, debug rendering issues, inspect the DOM and CSS, analyze performance, and automate user flows, fundamentally transforming it from a 'blind' code generator into a 'sighted' development partner.

This initiative is a critical step towards building a more powerful and autonomous AI-native development environment.

## Top-Level Items & Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Integration & Verification
- **Goal:** Configure the MCP server and verify basic connectivity and functionality.

### Phase 2: 'Sighted' Development Workflow
- **Goal:** Integrate browser-based verification into the agent's core development and PR review workflows.
