# Update Default Expansion in Release Index

**Goal:** Modify `buildScripts/createReleaseIndex.mjs` to change the default expansion logic of the Release Tree.

**Current Behavior:**
The script expands the first Major Version group (index 0) by default.

**Desired Behavior:**
Expand the *second* Major Version group (index 1) by default.
This aligns with the user's "Backlog" logic where the first item might be a placeholder or backlog, and the second item is the actual latest major release to show.

**Task:**
- Update `buildScripts/createReleaseIndex.mjs`:
    - Change `if (index === 0)` to `if (index === 1)` in the flattening loop.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have updated `buildScripts/createReleaseIndex.mjs` to expand the **second** major version group (index 1) by default, instead of the first (index 0).
> 
> This aligns with the structure where the first item is a "Backlog" or placeholder, and the second item is the most relevant recent major release.
