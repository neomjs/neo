## Why Organizations Choose Neo.mjs

Are your development teams burdened by slow build times, the debugging complexities introduced by transpilation and
unreliable source maps, or battling UI freezes because ***traditional frameworks (like Angular, React, or Vue) often limit
your application to a single CPU core?*** Traditional frontend development often comes with these frustrating compromises.

***Neo.mjs fundamentally redefines the web development experience, offering a solution that is both revolutionary for
developers and unmatched in performance.***

### Lightning-Fast Development & App-Centric Creation

Forget the constant interruptions of build processes in your daily workflow. Neo.mjs empowers an instant, zero-builds
development mode, allowing you to work directly with 100% web standards-based JavaScript. This dramatically accelerates
your team's velocity and simplifies debugging, letting you focus purely on innovation.

Moreover, Neo.mjs shifts the paradigm: instead of just writing UI components that feel like HTML, you'll ***create entire
applications***. Thanks to its revolutionary ***Unified Config System***, you define complex application structures—from
components and layouts to data models—purely through declarative configurations, gaining unparalleled control and efficiency.

### Unparalleled Performance & Scalability

Neo.mjs is engineered from the ground up for extreme performance. Unlike most frameworks that are limited to a single CPU
core per browser tab, Neo.mjs leverages a ***truly multi-threaded architecture***. Your application logic runs ***off the
main thread*** across dedicated Web Workers, ensuring your UI remains silky smooth, responsive, and free from freezes,
even under heavy computation.

This unique design enables your applications to scale not just in raw performance, but also in ***complexity and scope,
growing effortlessly from a tiny proof-of-concept to a massive enterprise application with hundreds of dynamic views.***
Features like intelligent lazy loading and runtime-built state trees ensure the framework effortlessly manages large-scale
application growth and intricate multi-window experiences.

### Architectural Brilliance & Future-Proofing

Built on cutting-edge web standards, Neo.mjs embraces an "Application Worker being the Main Actor" paradigm.
This robust architecture inherently prevents common issues like UI blocking and memory leaks. Furthermore, Neo.mjs
uniquely handles ***dynamic, run-time module imports*** without the traditional bundler overhead, offering flexibility
for advanced scenarios like user-editable code.
