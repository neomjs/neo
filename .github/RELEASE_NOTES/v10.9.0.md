# Neo.mjs v10.9.0 Release Notes

This release marks a significant milestone in our journey towards a fully AI-native development environment. The primary focus of v10.9.0 is the extension of the AI Knowledge Base to support workspaces, fulfilling the vision of providing deep, semantic understanding of not just the framework, but of your own applications.

Alongside this flagship feature, this release includes a suite of improvements to our internal AI agent processes and documentation standards, making our development workflow more robust and transparent.

## âœ¨ Highlights

### ðŸš€ AI Knowledge Base for Workspaces

The AI Knowledge Base is no longer confined to the `neo` repository. It is now fully integrated into the standard workspace workflow, enabling any project created with `npx neo-app` to have its own local, context-aware knowledge base. This empowers AI agents to understand your specific application code, leading to more accurate, relevant, and helpful contributions (#7245).

-   **Workspace-Aware Tooling:** The `create-app` script now automatically sets up the necessary files (`AGENTS.md`, `AI_QUICK_START.md`) and environment configuration for the AI knowledge base to work out-of-the-box in new workspaces.
-   **Portable AI Scripts:** The core AI scripts (`createKnowledgeBase`, `embedKnowledgeBase`, `queryKnowledgeBase`) have been refactored to be environment-aware, seamlessly operating within either the core `neo` repo or a generated workspace.
-   **Updated Onboarding:** The `AI_QUICK_START.md` guide has been updated to provide clear setup instructions for both framework contributors and application developers working in a workspace (#7247).

### ðŸ§  Enhanced Knowledge Base Content & Discovery

The quality and accessibility of the knowledge base have been significantly improved through better content integration and smarter querying.

-   **Release Notes in KB:** All historical release notes are now embedded into the knowledge base, allowing developers and agents to query for information about when features were introduced or changed (#7241).
-   **Smarter Query Scoring:** The query algorithm has been refined to prioritize evergreen content like guides over historical blog posts (#7243) and to provide more accurate results for version-specific queries (#7242).
-   **Optimized Structure File:** The initial structure file (`structure.json`) used by the agent has been replaced with a new, highly efficient `class-hierarchy.yaml` file. This dramatically reduces the token footprint while still providing a complete map of the framework's class inheritance, improving the agent's startup performance and reliability (#7246).

### ðŸ¤– Agent & Contributor Process Automation

This release formalizes and automates key aspects of our development and ticketing workflow, making the process more robust and transparent for both AI and human contributors.

-   **Hybrid Ticket Strategy:** A new, formal ticket strategy has been documented in `TICKET_STRATEGY.md`, defining a clear lifecycle for tasks from creation to archival (#7239).
-   **"Ticket-First" Mandate:** The agent's core workflow has been updated to enforce a strict "ticket-first" mandate, ensuring every modification to the repository is tracked from its inception (#7240, #7248).

### ðŸ“š Documentation & Code Quality

-   **New `Neo.component.Image`:** A new `Image` component has been added, providing a reactive, class-based interface for the `<img>` tag. This serves as a foundational component for image handling and lazy loading patterns (#7244).
-   **Formalized JSDoc Standards:** The project's `CODING_GUIDELINES.md` have been updated with explicit standards for documenting reactive configs using the `@reactive` tag, ensuring consistency across the codebase (#7237).
-   **Enhanced Example Documentation:** The Helix component example has been updated with rich, query-driven JSDoc comments, making it a better learning resource and a prime example of our new documentation standards (#7236).
