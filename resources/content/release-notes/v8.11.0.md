# Table Selection Models

* All table SMs are now completely decoupled from DOM based cell or row focus
* The `tbody` node is now the only focus receiver (we could change this, in case we want focus based navigation without selecting)
* Grid & Table SMs are in sync again
* ComboBox now fires a change event, when the value is null & forceSelection is enabled
* Fixed the Table Filtering example: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6298
* Fixed a glitch inside the table.container example: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6324
* Neo.Main.getByPath() can now also trigger window based methods: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6314
