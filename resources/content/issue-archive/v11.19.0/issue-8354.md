# Finalize README Application Engine Rebrand and Terminology

Implement the final feedback loop for the `README.md` rebrand to position Neo.mjs as an "Application Engine".

**Changes Required:**
1.  **Insert "Is Neo.mjs Right for You?" Section:** Add a qualification section after the video demos to filter users (Financial/Trading vs. Blogs).
2.  **Elevate "The Neural Link":** Move it from the list to a dedicated "Killer Feature" section after "The AI-Native Development Platform".
3.  **Refine "388 Tickets" Wording:** Update text to emphasize "velocity" and "architectural enhancements" instead of just ticket resolution.
4.  **Reorder Sections:** Re-structure the document flow to: Hero -> Visuals -> Filter -> Pivot -> Neural Link -> CTA -> Architecture -> Comparison -> Subsystems.

**Goal:** Blend architectural authority with conversion flow to finalize the "Engine" positioning.
