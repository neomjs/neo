# Neo.mjs v11.14.0 Release Notes

**The Genesis of the Autonomous Agent.**

Just two days after v11.13.0, we are accelerating our roadmap with a transformative release. The Neo.mjs AI ecosystem has evolved rapidly. We began with the **Code Execution Pattern** ("Thick Client"), enabling agents to write and execute scripts that directly imported our internal services (`ai/services.mjs`).

With v11.14.0, we are building the next layer of this evolution: the **`Neo.ai.Agent`** class.

This release transitions the framework from a collection of powerful tools into a true **Agent Operating System**. Agents are no longer just ad-hoc scripts; they are now first-class citizens with a standardized lifecycle, a cognitive runtime, and the ability to connect to the wider world via the Model Context Protocol.

> **📊 Development Velocity**
> This release contains **43 closed issues** across **4 major epics**, delivered in just **54 hours** since v11.13.0. This was achieved through a unique hybrid workflow: human architectural decisions + AI-assisted implementation using the very agents we're building.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🧠 The Birth of Neo.ai.Agent & The Cognitive Runtime

We have formalized the agent into a robust class structure. The new `Neo.ai.Agent` is an autonomous daemon powered by a sophisticated **Cognitive Loop**:

```
    ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                    │
    │   ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐    │
    │   │ PERCEIVE │ ──→ │  REASON  │    │
    │   │ (Queue)  │     │  (LLM)   │    │
    │   └──────────┘     └──────────┘    │
    │        ↑                 │         │
    │        │                 ↓         │
    │   ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐    │
    │   │ REFLECT  │ ←── │   ACT    │    │
    │   │(Memory)  │     │ (Tools)  │    │
    │   └──────────┘     └──────────┘    │
    │                                    │
    └────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Innovation:** The **REFLECT** phase enables self-correction and continuous improvement without human intervention.

This architecture creates a **"Level 3 Autonomy"** baseline:
- **Level 1:** Script-based (must be manually invoked)
- **Level 2:** Reactive (responds to explicit prompts)
- **Level 3:** **Autonomous (monitors and acts proactively) ← We are here**
- **Level 4:** Collaborative (multi-agent coordination) ← *Coming in Phase 4*
- **Level 5:** Self-improving (agents modify their own code)

### 🧩 Expanding Horizons: MCP Client SDK

We have introduced the **MCP Client SDK** (`Neo.ai.mcp.Client`), powered by the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. This allows Neo.mjs agents to connect to **any** standard MCP server.

This unlocks two powerful capabilities:
1.  **Internal Power:** Agents can now seamlessly use our three robust, built-in servers via the standard protocol:
    *   `github-workflow`: Full project management.
    *   `knowledge-base`: Semantic search.
    *   `memory-core`: Long-term memory.
2.  **External Reach:** Agents can connect to the broader ecosystem of third-party MCP servers, configured simply via `servers: ['my-external-server']`.

### 🖥️ Agent OS: Realizing "The Command Center"

Fulfilling **Phase 3** of our roadmap, we have scaffolded the **Agent OS** (`apps/agent-os`), a specialized multi-window application designed to visualize and control the swarm.
*   **Multi-Window Architecture:** Separation of concerns with a "Strategy Window" for high-level planning and a "Swarm Window" for real-time intervention.
*   **Blackboard Visualization:** A new Canvas-based graph visualization (PoC) that renders the state of the agent swarm (Issues/Tasks) in real-time using Force-Directed Physics in a dedicated worker.

### 🏭 The Feature Factory Experiment

We built the system, then **used it to build itself**. Two specialized agents successfully demonstrated full-cycle autonomous development:

-   **`pm.mjs` (Project Manager Agent):** Autonomously broke Epic #7961 into sub-issues with proper labels, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.
-   **`dev.mjs` (Developer Agent):** Converted tickets into working PRs with tests, documentation, and changelog entries.

This experiment validated our architecture under real-world complexity and will inform the design of the full Swarm orchestration layer.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**None.** This release is fully backward compatible with v11.13.0.

The new `Neo.ai.Agent` class is additive and does not affect existing code execution patterns or MCP servers.

## 🚀 Getting Started with Autonomous Agents

### For Existing MCP Server Users:

Your code continues to work unchanged. To upgrade to autonomous mode:

```javascript
// Before: Manual script execution
const result = await KB_QueryService.queryDocuments({query: 'button'});

// After: Autonomous agent with cognitive loop
const agent = Neo.create(Agent, {
    modelProvider: GeminiProvider,
    servers      : ['knowledge-base']
});

await agent.ready();

agent.schedule({type: 'user:input', data: 'Find button docs'});
agent.start();
```

The agent now runs continuously, reacting to events and maintaining context.

## 🤝 A Note on Collaboration

This release was developed in a unique hybrid workflow:
- **Architecture & Vision:** Human-driven
- **Implementation & Testing:** AI-assisted via Gemini
- **Quality Control:** Collaborative review

The cognitive loop agents used the same MCP servers and tools we're releasing, effectively **dogfooding the platform in real-time**.

## 🔮 What's Next: Completing The Neural Link

**Phase 4 is actively underway.** The cognitive runtime (v11.14.0) provides the "brain".
Now we're implementing the bidirectional communication layer—the "nervous system":

**In Progress:**
- Epic #7960: WebSocket RMA Proof of Concept
- Epic #7957: WebSocket RMA Infrastructure
- Epic #7958: Telemetry & Observability (LogBridge)
- Epic #7959: Agent Security & Capabilities

**Target: December 2025**

This will enable agents to observe browser state in real-time and manipulate applications dynamically via WebSocket RMA, completing the Neural Link architecture outlined in `.github/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

At our current velocity (43 issues in 2 days for v11.14.0), we expect v11.15.0 (Neural Link Complete) to ship within 2 weeks, enabling full bidirectional agent-browser communication.
