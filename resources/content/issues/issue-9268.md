# Create DevIndex Guide: Talent Scouts & Recruiters

**Objective:** Create a guide targeting recruiters to shift the perception of DevIndex from "data scraper" to "career enablement platform."
**Key Points:**
- How to use the `Hireable` filter effectively.
- How to interpret the "Cyborg Metrics" (Velocity, Acceleration, Consistency).
- Emphasize the value of the Consistency badge (🏛️) to find "10x" or "100x" developers who have been quietly and reliably contributing for 10+ years, proving that such elite performance profiles are not a myth.
- Note the v1 limitation regarding location (filtering is limited to Country ISO codes, not specific cities, due to the free-form nature of GitHub's location field).

**Input from Gemini 3.1 Pro:**

> ✦ **Note for future agent session:** 
> Before starting work on this guide, you **MUST** read the following existing documentation as critical context:
> - `learn/guides/devindex/Methodology.md` (To understand how Cyborg Metrics are mathematically calculated)
> - `learn/guides/devindex/UserGuide.md` (To understand the UI columns, especially the "Hireable" flag)

### @tobiu - 2026-02-23T17:51:22Z

**Input from Gemini 3.1 Pro:**

> ✦ I've completed the Persona Guide for Talent Scouts & Recruiters.
> 
> Key enhancements included:
> - Clarifying how the **Hireable Filter** functions while also adding a "Pro-Tip" warning that top-tier developers might be looking for roles even if they haven't explicitly toggled this somewhat hidden GitHub flag.
> - Breaking down the "Cyborg Metrics" (Velocity, Acceleration, Consistency) to aid interpretation.
> - Demystifying the "10x Developer" by focusing on long-term Consistency and emphasizing that foundational engineers who reliably maintain high volume over a decade are the true top performers.
> - Directly addressing the "Buzzword Bingo" problem by explaining that specific skill flags are largely irrelevant for developers in the top 25% of the index, given their profound foundational knowledge and rapid adaptability.
> - Explaining the current limitations of location filtering (v1) in relation to GitHub's free-form location text fields.
> 
> The guide was properly organized within the navigation structure inside `tree.json` (as the first guide within a new "Persona Guides" section, located beneath the "User Guide").
> 
> Commit with the ticket reference is pushed. Closing this issue.
