# Enhance Sitemap Generation: Include Top-Level Application Routes

The current sitemap generated by `buildScripts/generate-seo-files.mjs` only includes content from the `/learn` section of the application. It does not cover the main top-level application routes such as `/home`, `/blog`, `/about-us`, `/docs`, `/examples`, and `/services`. These are critical entry points for users and should be discoverable by search engines.

This ticket proposes to enhance the `generate-seo-files.mjs` script to include these top-level application routes in the generated `sitemap.xml`.

**Implementation Details:**
- The `generate-seo-files.mjs` script will need to be updated to identify and extract the top-level routes.
- A possible approach is to read the `static routeMetadata` object from `apps/portal/view/ViewportController.mjs` to obtain the list of these routes.
- The extracted routes should then be formatted as canonical, hash-based URLs (e.g., `https://neomjs.com/#/home`) and added to the `sitemap.xml`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `sitemap.xml` generated by `generate-seo-files.mjs` includes all top-level application routes defined in `ViewportController.mjs`.
- The URLs for these routes are canonical and hash-based (e.g., `https://neomjs.com/#/home`).
