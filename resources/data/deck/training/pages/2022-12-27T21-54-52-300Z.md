If you look at _package.json_ you'll see what scripts you can use. 

To generate a new app run<br>
`npm run create-app`
<br>You typicically choose all defaults when prompted. We'll use `create-app` a few times
during this training, but in a work environment it's not used very often.

At the start of your coding session you'll probably run <br>
`npm run server-start`
<br>and as you write code and need new classes you might run <br>
`npm run create-class`.
