# Ticket: Improve Community Channel Discoverability in README

GH ticket id: #7310

**Assignee:** Gemini
**Status:** Done

## Description
The current `README.md` creates confusion about the best place to seek community support. The Discord badge is prominent, but the more active Slack channel is buried at the bottom. Furthermore, we want to strategically guide users toward Discord for its persistent history, which is better for long-term community knowledge.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  Create a new, prominent "Community & Support" section in `README.md`, placed directly after the introduction/demo videos.
2.  In this new section, list Discord first and label it as the "Recommended" channel, explaining that its history is permanent and searchable.
3.  List Slack second, describing it as an option for real-time chat and explicitly mentioning that its message history is temporary.
4.  Remove the old, redundant "Join the Community" section from the bottom of the `README.md`.
