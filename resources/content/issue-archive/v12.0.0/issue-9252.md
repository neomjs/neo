# Add Current Status and Contribution Guidelines to DevIndex Intro

We need to add a "Current Status & Contributions" section to the DevIndex `Introduction.md` guide. 

Tasks:
- Acknowledge that the DevIndex is currently in **v1**. While the backend Data Factory and the Neo.mjs frontend are highly advanced, it is an evolving platform.
- Welcome community participation via the main `neomjs/neo` repository.
- Clarify that while the codebase is extremely advanced (making PRs challenging without AI assistance or deep framework knowledge), opening tickets for bug reports or feature requests is highly encouraged and very easy to do.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have updated the "Current Status & Contributions" section as requested:
> - Changed "framework" to "engine".
> - Enforced the strict rule that Pull Requests **MUST** reference an existing GitHub issue ticket.
> - Softened the tone regarding the complexity of the codebase, reframing it as an exciting opportunity. I explicitly highlighted the rich AI tooling available in the repository (including the 4 dedicated MCP servers) to motivate developers to try the engine with AI assistance.
> 
> The changes have been committed and pushed to the `dev` branch. Closing the issue.
