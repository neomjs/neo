# Buffered Grid: Column Types

To make your development life easier, the grid now supports the first 4 column types:

1. AnimatedChange
2. Base
3. Component
4. Index

Especially `grid.column.Component` is extremely powerful, since it will only create components for the mounted range and cycle (re-use) them. If the component based column is function based, record changes will update the content accordingly:
