# Remove Rich from the license files

After ghosting me for 6 years, @rwaters pulled it off again => refusing to communicate.

* Rich, you told me that by November (last year), you will hop back in.
* I was excited about it, since you are wasting your talent on meaningless projects.
* I don't expect you to put in many hours to help out on the coding side
* Not being involved in the planing is a no go though (a call every 2 weeks would have been sufficient)
* Right now, I don't know when or even if you ever planned to join the project again
* How should I, when you don't even answer to emails or join calls

This is not acceptable.

This was exactly what Patrick Sheridan @sheridap warned me about. Not a good example, since Pat was all about breaking promises and lies.

While lacking integrity and having no values might be a trend in today's society, it does not make it ok.

Leaving people hanging when I know that they need help is something I would never do. Maybe I just care too much.

I hope for both of you, that karma never finds you.
