# Smarter environment combinations

* The main item of this release relates to `code.LivePreview`, which will now inside `dist/production` pull in code which can not get bundled from `dist/esm`. See: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/6770
* The docs app now shows an info message to use `npm run generate-docs-json`, in case there is no content
* The next `npx neo-app` version will cut down the execution time by over 50%, excluding the docs parsing.
* `data.Store.load()` is now async
