/**
 * Covers the fail-closed matrix for `FleetCockpit.loadActivity()` — the app-side consumption of the
 * read-observe `fleetActivity` bridge verb.
 *
 * `loadActivity`'s unit is its ROUTING decision: given the bridge's honest capability state, which
 * `adapterState` (+ event order) does it apply to the stream? The stream is a collaborator, so it is
 * mocked with a spy that records what `loadActivity` sets — this pins the routing precisely and in
 * isolation. That the REAL `ActivityStream` renders each `adapterState` (sample / live / stale) is
 * covered by `activityStream.spec.mjs`; here we prove `loadActivity` chooses the right one.
