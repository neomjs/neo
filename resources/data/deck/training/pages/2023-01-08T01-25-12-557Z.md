What's the goal of this somewhat lengthy topic?

- To touch on fundamental Neo concepts
- To do some coding without emphasizing syntax details

Most of these labs are copy-and-paste because we're focusing
on _what_ it's doing on rather than _how_. 

As we progress through the training we'll spend more and
more time on syntax and _how_, and you'll be more and more
proficient at writing your own code.
