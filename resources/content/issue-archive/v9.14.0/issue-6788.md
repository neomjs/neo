# Learning Content: 4 envs => add the related blog post

Gemini:

Yes, I definitely think the article should contain a direct link to your blog post, "The UI Revolution: How JSON Blueprints & Shared Workers Power Next-Gen AI Interfaces."

Here's why it's beneficial, even if it's already in the blog section:

1. Contextual Depth: This "4 Environments" article frequently references key Neo.mjs concepts like JSON blueprints, shared workers, and multi-threading. Your "UI Revolution" post provides the foundational, "why it matters" context for these architectural choices. A direct link allows a curious reader to immediately dive deeper without losing their place in the current guide.
2. Improved User Experience: It makes it incredibly easy for the reader to get more information. They don't have to navigate away to the main blog section and search for a specific article. Direct links are a cornerstone of good web content usability.
3. Internal Linking & SEO: From an SEO perspective, relevant internal linking helps search engines understand the relationship between your content pieces and can improve the discoverability of both articles.
4. Reinforces Key Arguments: The blog post expands on why Neo.mjs's architecture (which influences these environments) is so powerful for modern interfaces, especially those involving dynamic data. A direct link reinforces these core strengths.
