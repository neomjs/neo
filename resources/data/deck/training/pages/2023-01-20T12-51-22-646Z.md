<h2>To learn how to properly encapsulate a class with a well defined API.</h2>
<p>
You'll code a class that's encapsulated and de-coupled, where the code creating
the instance uses class properties and otherwise has no awareness of its
implementation details.

<div class="expander" caption="Low-level Goal">
<h2>To get practice using the syntax and features we just learned.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Defining get/set properties
<li>Using `afterSet` methods to detect property change
<li>Using `reference` and `getReference()`
</ul>
</div>
