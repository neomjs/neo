# Update Code Execution Guide for Application Engine Branding and Neural Link

Update `learn/guides/mcp/CodeExecution.md` to align with the new "Application Engine" branding and include the Neural Link service.

Tasks:
- Add "Neural Link" to the "Key Services" table.
- Replace instances of "framework" with "Application Engine" or "core" where appropriate.
- Ensure the document reflects the 4-server architecture (Knowledge Base, Memory Core, GitHub Workflow, Neural Link).
