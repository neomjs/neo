# Refine DevIndex Introduction Disclaimer and Cap Context

The current legal disclaimer in the DevIndex `Introduction.md` refers to the project as a "tech demo" and uses marketing language. We need to rewrite this to adopt an "understatement" philosophy, framing it as an independent community resource.

Additionally, we need to clarify the context around the 50k user cap in the documentation, explaining that while the engine can effortlessly handle more, the cut is made purely to limit the download size (currently ~23MB before gzip) and mentioning the current entry threshold (2,134 lifetime contributions as of Feb 27, 2026).

## Timeline

- 2026-02-27T09:39:03Z @tobiu added the `documentation` label
- 2026-02-27T09:39:03Z @tobiu added the `enhancement` label
- 2026-02-27T09:39:03Z @tobiu added the `ai` label
- 2026-02-27T09:40:39Z @tobiu referenced in commit `71332d0` - "docs(devindex): Refine Introduction disclaimer and cap context (#9323)

- Rewrote legal disclaimer to use a more understated tone, framing DevIndex as an independent index rather than a tech demo.
- Removed marketing language to let the framework's performance speak for itself.
- Updated the Meritocracy Filter section to reflect the ~23MB uncompressed file size.
- Added context that the current entry bar for the top 50k is 2,134 lifetime contributions (as of Feb 27, 2026)."
