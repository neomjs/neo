# Update Portal shared background color to #fcfcfc

Update the `.portal-shared-background` rule in `resources/scss/src/apps/portal/Viewport.scss`.
Replace the `background-color` variable `var(--sem-color-bg-neutral-default)` (which resolves to `#fafafa`) with the hex value `#fcfcfc`.
This change is intended to improve readability in content-heavy views like markdown releases and learning content by providing a slightly lighter background.
