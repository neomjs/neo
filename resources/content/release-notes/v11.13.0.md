# Neo.mjs v11.13.0 Release Notes

This release enhances the **GitHub Workflow MCP server** with improved configuration options for managing issue archives. It standardizes how versioned directories are named, ensuring a consistent structure for your project's history.

## ✨ Highlights

### 📁 Standardized Archive Directories

We have introduced a new configuration option, `versionDirectoryPrefix`, to the GitHub Workflow server. This setting unifies the naming convention for all version-based archive directories.

Whether an issue is archived because of a **Milestone** or a **Release Tag**, the resulting folder in `.github/ISSUE_ARCHIVE/` will now consistently use this prefix (defaulting to `'v'`, e.g., `v1.2.3/`). The implementation includes robust logic to handle various input formats, ensuring that version strings are never "double-prefixed" (e.g., avoiding `vv1.2.3`).

## 📦 Full Changelog

### AI MCP Servers
-   **Enhancement: Add versionDirectoryPrefix to GitHub Workflow MCP config** (Issue #7911, Issue #7912)
    -   Introduced `versionDirectoryPrefix` to control folder naming for both milestones and releases.
    -   Implemented smart prefixing logic to handle raw (`1.2.3`) and pre-prefixed (`v1.2.3`) version strings consistently across Issue and Release syncers.
