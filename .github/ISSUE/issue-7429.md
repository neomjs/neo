# Refine and Update Project Roadmap

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-10-09

---

**Parent Issue:** #7264 - Enhance Development Workflow with a Planning Phase

---

This ticket documents the collaborative effort to refine and update the `ROADMAP.md` file, aligning it with the project's current strategic thinking.

The key refinements include:

1.  **Introducing the "Context Engineering" Theme:** The roadmap is now framed around this core concept, clarifying the strategic purpose of our AI tooling and infrastructure work.
2.  **Clarifying the MCP Architecture:** The roadmap now explicitly details the **three** planned MCP servers (Knowledge Base, Memory Core, GitHub Sync).
3.  **Detailing the Decoupling Strategy:** A new section was added to outline the v11.1 plan to publish the Memory Core and GitHub Sync servers as standalone npm packages from within the mono-repo.
4.  **Enhancing Initiative Descriptions:** The "Mandatory Unit Testing" initiative was expanded to explain the "why" behind the migration to a Node.js-based test runner (enabling agent self-verification and CI/CD).
