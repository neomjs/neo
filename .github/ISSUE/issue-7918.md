# Epic: Neo Command Center (Agent OS UI)

# Epic: Neo Command Center (Agent OS UI)

This epic covers Phase 3 of the Agent OS Roadmap: building the "Killer App" that visualizes and controls the agent swarm. This will be a multi-window Neo.mjs application serving as the "God View" for the digital organization.

## Goals
1.  **Visual Orchestration:** Provide a spatial interface to see active agents, tasks, and status.
2.  **Derailment Recovery:** Enable "Human-in-the-Loop" intervention when agents get blocked.
3.  **Dogfooding:** Build the interface using the Neo.mjs framework itself, demonstrating its multi-window capabilities.

## Key Deliverables
1.  **Dashboard Layout:** A multi-window workspace design (Strategy, Swarm, Intervention).
2.  **Real-time Visualization:** A "Blackboard" component that renders the state of the GitHub Issue swarm.
3.  **Intervention UI:** A chat-like interface to guide stuck agents.
