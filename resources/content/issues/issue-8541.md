# Feature: Canvas-based "Neural" TreeList Animation

**Concept:** Apply the "Neural" Canvas animation to the `TicketsTreeList` (left nav).

**Why:** Unlike the ticket body, the TreeList has 1000s of items and infinite scroll, making it a perfect candidate to demonstrate high-performance, off-main-thread animation at scale.

**Ideas:**
- **Indentation Guide:** A glowing line that traces the active hierarchy branch.
- **Scanner Effect:** A "Cylon" or "Knight Rider" style scanner that highlights the active ticket.
