# Increase InterventionPanel grid Priority column width

The 'Priority' column in the `InterventionPanel` grid is currently set to `width: 80`, which is visually too narrow relative to its bold header text.

This task involves updating `apps/agentos/view/InterventionPanel.mjs` to increase the width of the 'Priority' column (e.g., to 100px) to improve readability and visual balance.
