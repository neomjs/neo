In this topic you'll create an application that fetches data on earthquakes in Iceland,
and show the information in two views: a table, and a map.
You'll do this in a series of simple labs. 

What are the goals of this lengthy topic?

- To give you hands-on coding a simple app
- To introduce fundamental Neo concepts

Most of these labs are copy-and-paste because we're focusing on _what_ the code is doing on rather than _how_.

For this tutorial don't worry about syntax details. Other tutorials and guides will spend more and 
more time on syntax.e

## Key concepts

A few key concepts we'll be discussing:

- Creating a starter app
- Configuring components
- Debugging
- Class-based coding
- View models
- Events
- Controllers

## Advice

A word of advice: Keep a high-level perspective, especially early on. We'll have plenty of time to get 
into the code, and we'll do most things multiple times. In other words, focus on what you're accomplishing,
and don't worry about syntax details.
