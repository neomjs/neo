## Neo.mjs v10.0.0-beta.1 Release Notes

We are excited to announce the release of Neo.mjs v10.0.0-beta.1, bringing significant architectural improvements, enhanced developer experience, and various stability fixes.

### Key Highlights:

* **Asynchronous Initialization with `initAsync()`**: The `core.Base` class now includes a powerful `async initAsync()` method, allowing asynchronous code to be executed outside of the traditional constructor chain, leveraging the microtask queue. This is a crucial improvement for registering **Remote Method Access** earlier in the application lifecycle, effectively eliminating a previously observed 4ms delay caused by reliance on the macro task queue.
* **Enhanced `main.addon.Base`**: The `main.addon.Base` class has received substantial enhancements to dynamically load files based on the new `initAsync` mechanism and properly respect the new `isReady_` configuration.
* **Revamped Learning Content Structure**: The entire Learning Content has been reorganized and moved into a new `learn` top-level repository folder.
* **Improved Learning Content Rendering**: The comprehensive Learning Content has been significantly enhanced to render more beautifully across different viewing environments. This was achieved by adopting standard Markdown fenced code blocks with info strings (e.g., ````javascript live-preview````). This ensures native syntax highlighting and excellent readability when viewed directly on the GitHub repository. Simultaneously, Neo.mjs's `ContentComponent.mjs` is now capable of dynamically processing these blocks for interactive features (such as `live-preview` and `neo-component` instantiation) and specialized styling (like `readonly` code blocks) within the Neo.mjs website. Specific SCSS adjustments in `ContentComponent.scss` further guarantee consistent and correct rendering of various code block types, including plain text/directory structures, by utilizing precise selectors like `:not(.hljs)` to prevent conflicts with Highlight.js and maintain visual integrity.
* **Grid and Table Refactoring Polish**: The extensive refactoring of `grid.View` to `grid.Body` and `table.View` to `table.Body` has been thoroughly polished and is now considered fully stable.
* **Delta Generation Fix**: A critical glitch within the v10 delta generation logic has been fixed, significantly reducing the amount of created deltas and ensuring that changes applied to the DOM are once again minimized to the bare essential.
