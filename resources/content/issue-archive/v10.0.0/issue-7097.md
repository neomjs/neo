# Create Deep-Dive Blog Post for Functional Components

## 1. Goal
Create a detailed blog post explaining the new functional component model in v10.

## 2. Target Audience
Developers who want to understand how to build UIs with the new API.

## 3. Key Talking Points
- **Title Idea:** *A Deep Dive into Neo.mjs Functional Components*
- **Concepts:**
    - `defineComponent()`
    - `useConfig()` for internal state.
    - The crucial distinction between **named configs** (public API) and **anonymous configs** (private state).
    - `useEvent()` for event handling.
    - The seamless integration layer between functional and classic components.

## 4. Deliverable
A complete draft of the blog post as a markdown file.
