# Feature: Create Comparisons Overview Page

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-07-12

---

**Parent Issue:** #7029 - Feature: Add Framework Comparison Articles to Learn Directory

---

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
As more framework comparison articles are added to the `learn` directory, there is a need for a central entry point to introduce the section and list available comparisons.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Create an `Overview.md` file within the `learn/comparisons/` directory. This file will serve as the main introduction to the framework comparisons section. It should:

*   Introduce the purpose of the comparison articles.
*   State the intent to compare frameworks from a technical, objective, and constructive perspective.
*   List all available comparison articles with links.
*   Mention that more comparisons will be added over time.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
(None considered, as this is the proposed solution.)

**Additional context**
This overview page enhances the discoverability and usability of the framework comparison documentation.

**Affected Files:**
*   `learn/comparisons/Overview.md` (new file)
*   `learn/tree.json` (updated to include this overview)
