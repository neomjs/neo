# Feat: Implement Agent OS Multi-Window Layout

Implement the initial multi-window layout for the Agent OS Command Center.
- Primary Window: Strategy View (Main)
- Secondary Window: Swarm/Intervention View
- Ensure the application supports managing multiple windows.
- Refactor `apps/agent-os/view/Viewport.mjs` to implement this layout.

> - Swarm Window: Shows the split Swarm/Intervention View.
> - Connectivity: The Main Window successfully launches the Swarm Window.
> - Verified: Screenshots confirm both windows render correctly.
