# Create Test Plan for component.Video

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-10-14

**Parent Issue:** #7475 - Create Component Test Plans (Hacktoberfest Cookbook)

---

Your pull request should contain a single new file:

-   `.github/ISSUE/ticket-cpm-test-component-video.md`

This file will contain the test plan generated by following the cookbook.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Read the Guide:** Before you start, please read the main epic guide carefully:
    - #7475

2.  **Request Assignment:** If you would like to work on this ticket, please leave a comment here asking to be assigned.

3.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Please wait for a project maintainer to confirm your assignment before you start working. This helps prevent multiple contributors from working on the same ticket.

4.  **Start your AI session:** Once your assignment is confirmed, you can begin the work. Start your session with the AI agent by providing the local file paths for both this ticket and the main cookbook epic. This gives the agent the full context. For example:

    > "Hi Gemini, I am assigned to this ticket: `@.github/ISSUE/ticket-component-testing-cookbook-component-video.md`. Please use this cookbook as our guide: `@.github/ISSUE/epic-cookbook-create-test-plans.md`."

5.  **Follow the Cookbook:** The cookbook epic will then guide you and the agent through the process of analyzing the component and generating the test plan.
