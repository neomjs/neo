# Implement Tickets View Structure (Scaffolding)

Duplicate `apps/portal/view/news/release` to `apps/portal/view/news/tickets` and rename classes to `Portal.view.news.tickets.*`. This serves as the scaffolding for the new Tickets section in the Portal.

This work is part of the parent issue #8398.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have created the scaffolding for the Tickets view by duplicating the structure from the Release view and updating the namespaces.
> The following files have been created:
> - `apps/portal/view/news/tickets/Component.mjs`
> - `apps/portal/view/news/tickets/MainContainer.mjs`
> - `apps/portal/view/news/tickets/MainContainerController.mjs`
> - `apps/portal/view/news/tickets/MainContainerStateProvider.mjs`
> 
> The view is ready to be integrated into the main application.
