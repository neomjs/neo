# Add Physics and SharedWorker items to Portal Hero Cycle

Add `'SharedWorker Simulations'` and `'Physics-Driven UI'` to `cycleTexts` in `apps/portal/view/home/parts/hero/Content.mjs`.

This highlights both the architectural capability and the visual result demonstrated by the Neural Swarm background.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ Added `'SharedWorker Simulations'` and `'Physics-Driven UI'` to the Portal Hero cycle text. This aligns the copy with the "Neural Swarm" background visualization and highlights the unique architectural capabilities of the engine.
