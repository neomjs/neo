# Update DevIndex Docs to Reflect Human-AI Development Velocity

The DevIndex documentation currently refers to a "Neo.mjs team" and a "core engineering team." This masks the true narrative of the project's development in 2026: extreme velocity achieved by a Human-AI pair.

We need to update the documentation to reflect that the DevIndex (including the data factory, UI, and a complete framework-level Grid rewrite) was built from scratch in exactly one month (February 2026) by a single developer and an AI agent, resolving approximately 400 GitHub tickets.

This is a critical proof-point for the "Cyborg Factor" and Neo.mjs as an AI-Native Application Engine. We should let the commit log and ticket history stand as the proof.

**Tasks:**
1. Update `Introduction.md` to tell the "Human-AI Pair / 400 tickets in one month" story under "The Engineering Investment."
2. Replace "team" with "maintainer", "creator", or "Human-AI pair" across other DevIndex guides (`OptIn.md`, `OptOut.md`, etc.).

## Timeline

- 2026-02-27T09:45:22Z @tobiu added the `documentation` label
- 2026-02-27T09:45:23Z @tobiu added the `enhancement` label
- 2026-02-27T09:45:23Z @tobiu added the `ai` label
- 2026-02-27T09:47:05Z @tobiu referenced in commit `75a5d16` - "docs(devindex): Update docs to reflect Human-AI development velocity (#9324)

- Rewrote 'The Engineering Investment' in Introduction.md to highlight the 'Cyborg Factor' (one solo dev + AI resolving 400 tickets in one month).
- Replaced references to 'core engineering team' and 'our team' with 'the maintainer', 'creator', or 'Human-AI pair' across all DevIndex guides to accurately reflect the project's development model."

**Input from Gemini 3.1 Pro:**

> ✦ I have updated `Introduction.md` to tell the true "Cyborg Factor" story under the Engineering Investment section. I also successfully replaced all instances of "our team" and "core engineering team" across the other DevIndex guides (`OptIn.md`, `OptOut.md`, etc.) with more accurate phrasing like "the maintainer" or "the creator". The changes have been committed and pushed to `dev`.
