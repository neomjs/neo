**Phase:** 3
**Assignee:**
**Status:** To Do

## Description

To enable community contributions and ensure the long-term maintainability of the new MCP server architecture, clear documentation for human developers is required.

This task involves creating a new guide in the `learn/guides/ai/` directory that explains the architecture of the new Knowledge and Memory MCP servers, how to run them, and how to extend them.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new guide is created at `learn/guides/ai/MCP_Server_Architecture.md`.
2.  The guide explains the rationale behind the MCP server approach.
3.  It provides clear instructions on how to start the Knowledge and Memory servers.
4.  It documents the API for each server (or links to the API design documents).
5.  It provides guidance on how a contributor could add new endpoints or extend the servers' functionality.
