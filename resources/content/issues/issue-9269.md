# Create DevIndex Guide: Data Scientists & Researchers

**Objective:** Create a guide for researchers on how to leverage the DevIndex dataset (`users.jsonl`).
**Key Points:**
- Explain the rich data structure (the multi-year contribution matrices).
- Detail how the heuristic badges are calculated mathematically.
- Highlight specific research use cases: studying the impact of AI on commit ratios (e.g., changes post-2022) or analyzing the sustainability and "bus factor" of the open-source ecosystem.
- Emphasize that this is a free, high-quality, open-data goldmine.

> ✦ **Note for future agent session:** 
> Before starting work on this guide, you **MUST** read the following existing documentation as critical context:
> - `learn/guides/devindex/Backend.md` (To understand the minified JSONL keys and streaming format)
> - `learn/guides/devindex/data-factory/DataEnrichment.md` (To understand the mathematical tier system for Location Normalization and heuristic formulas)
