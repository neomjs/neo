You rarely need `Neo.component.Base` instances &mdash; they're just too primitive.

A `Neo.component.Base` might be used as a placeholder, to be replaced 
later on with some other component type.

However, if you need to code a custom component &mdash; where you specify
your own DOM structure &mdash; then you'll extend `Ext.component.Base`.
We'll see an example of that later.
