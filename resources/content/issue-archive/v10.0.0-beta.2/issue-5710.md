## Timeline

### @Dinkh - 2024-08-10T16:13:38Z

We might want to add an example based on something we already have. No need - for now - to add something completely new.

- 2025-06-29T11:53:54Z @tobiu unassigned from @maxrahder
### @tobiu - 2025-06-29T11:55:16Z

closing this ticket, in favor of the new guide:
https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/learn/guides/MainThreadAddons.md

=> it also covers intercepting remote method calls, until an addon is ready (files are loaded).
