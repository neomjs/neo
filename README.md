# Welcome to neo.mjs!
neo.mjs enables you to create scalable & high performant Apps using more than just one CPU core.
No need to take care of a workers setup, and the cross channel communication on your own.

<h2 id="architectures">2. Scalable frontend architectures</h2>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neomjs/pages/master/resources/images/apps-today.png">

Most frontends today still look like this. Everything happens inside the main thread (browser window), leading to a poor rendering performance.
The business logic happens inside main as well, which can slow down DOM updates and animations.
The worst case would be a complete UI freeze.

To solve this performance problem, it is not enough to just move expensive tasks into a worker.
Instead, an application worker needs to be the main actor.
neo.mjs offers two different setups which follow the exact same API.
You can switch between <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker">dedicated</a> and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker">shared</a> workers at any point.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neomjs/pages/master/resources/images/workers-setup-v4.png">

The dedicated workers setup uses 3-6 threads (CPUs).
Most parts of the frameworks as well as your apps and components live within the app worker.
Main threads are as small and idle as possible (42KB) plus optional main thread addons.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neomjs/pages/master/resources/images/shared-workers-setup.png">

In case you want to e.g. create a web based IDE or a multi window banking / trading app,
the shared worker setup using 5+ threads (CPUs) is the perfect solution.

All main threads share the same data, resulting in less API calls.
You can move entire component trees across windows, while even keeping the same JS instances.
Cross window state management, cross window drag&drop and cross window delta CSS updates are available.

<h2 id="sw-covid19-app">3. Multi Browser Window COVID19 IN NUMBERS Demo App</h2>
The most compelling way to introduce a new framework might simply be to show what you can do with it.</br>

<h2 id="online-examples">7. Online Examples</h2>

You can find a full list of (desktop based) online examples here:</br>
<a href="https://neomjs.github.io/pages/">Online Examples</a>

You can pick between the 3 modes (development, dist/development, dist/production) for each one.

</br></br>
<h2 id="online-docs">8. Online Docs</h2>

The Online Docs are also included inside the Online Examples.

dist/production does not support lazy loading the examples yet, but works in every browser:</br>
<a href="https://neomjs.github.io/pages/node_modules/neo.mjs/dist/production/docs/index.html">Online Docs (dist/production)</a>

The development mode only works in Chrome and Safari Technology Preview, but does lazy load the example apps:</br>
<a href="https://neomjs.github.io/pages/node_modules/neo.mjs/docs/index.html">Online Docs (dev mode)</a>

**Hint**: As soon as you create your own apps, you want to use the docs app locally,</br>
since this will include documentation views for your own apps.

</br></br>
<h2 id="command-line-interface">9. Command-Line Interface</h2>
You can run several build programs inside your terminal.</br>
Please take a look at the <a href="./buildScripts/README.md">Command-Line Interface Guide</a>.

</br></br>
<h2 id="get-started">10. Ready to get started?</h2>

There are 3 different ways on how you can get the basics running locally.</br>
Please take a look at the <a href=".github/GETTING_STARTED.md">Getting Started Guide</a>.

Here is an in depth tutorial on how to build your first neo.mjs app:</br>
https://itnext.io/define-a-web-4-0-app-to-be-multi-threaded-9c495c0d0ef9?source=friends_link&sk=4d143ace05f0e9bbe82babd9433cc822
</br></br>
<h2 id="story--vision">11. Story & Vision</h2>

Although neo.mjs is ready to craft beautiful & blazing fast UIs,</br>
the current state is just a fraction of a bigger picture.

Take a look at the <a href=".github/STORY.md">Project Story</a> and <a href=".github/VISION.md">Vision</a>.

</br></br>
<h2 id="contributors">12. neo.mjs is in need for more contributors!</h2>

Another way to fasten up the neo.mjs development speed is to actively jump in.</br>
As the shiny "PRs welcome" badge suggests: open source is intended to be improved by anyone who is up for the challenge.

You can also write a guide in case you learned something new while using neo.mjs or just help to get more eyes on this project.

Either way, here are more infos: <a href="./CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing</a>

</br></br>
<h2 id="sponsors">13. neo.mjs is in need for sponsors!</h2>

neo.mjs is an MIT-licensed open source project with an ongoing development.</br>
So far the development was made possible with burning my (tobiu's) personal savings.</br>

This is obviously not sustainable. To enable me keep pushing like this, please support it.</br>
The benefit of doing so is getting results delivered faster.

<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/tobiu">Sponsor tobiu</a>
