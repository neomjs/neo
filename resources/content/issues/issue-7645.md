# Epic: Refactor and Extend GitHub Sync Service

This epic tracks the architectural refactoring of the `SyncService` to improve its maintainability, optimize its performance, and extend its functionality.

The current `SyncService` is monolithic, has a bloated metadata file, and needs to be broken down before new features like PR syncing can be added cleanly.
