The component base class introduces many important properties.

- `html:string` &mdash; for simple content or placeholder text


- `height`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight`
- `width`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`

- `style:{}` &mdash; sometimes convenient, although using css styles via `cls` is probably better
- `cls:[string]` &mdash; a array of CSS class strings

- `disabled:boolean`

- `_vdom` &mdash; for low-level content


- `mounted:boolean` &mdash; useful for `afterSetMounted`

There are also drag-and-drop hooks, and many other properties.
