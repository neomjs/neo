#Introduction

In this lab, you'll generate a Neo.mjs workspace and run the starter app.

#Steps

<details>
<summary>Use the command-line to generate the workspace</summary>

Use a terminal window to navigate to some parent folder, 
then run 

    npx neo-app@latest

You'll be propted for a workspace name, starter app name, etc &mdash; accept the default for everything.
As the command finishes it starts a server and opens a browser window.

<details>
<summary>Inspect the workspace</summary>

The workspace contains a local copy of the API docs, an `apps` directory (where your apps are found), 
and some other directories.

<details>
<summary>Run the starter app</summary>

By default, an app named `myapp` was created. You can run it by entering the `apps` directory and 
clicking `myapp`. It's a folder containing an `index.html` along with the source code for the app.
