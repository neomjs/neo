# Update Coding Guidelines for Class Top-Level JSDoc Comments and @summary Tag

The current coding guidelines lack explicit instructions for formatting class top-level JSDoc comments, particularly concerning the `@summary` tag and the empty line that should follow it before the main description. This leads to inconsistencies in documentation.

**Goal:**
Update `.github/CODING_GUIDELINES.md` to:
1.  Define the usage of `@summary` for a concise, one-sentence explanation of the class's purpose.
2.  Mandate an empty line after the `@summary` tag (or the last single-line tag like `@class`, `@extends`) and before the detailed description of the class.
