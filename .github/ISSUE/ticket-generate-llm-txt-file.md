# Ticket: Generate LLM.txt File via Build Script

GH ticket id: #7452

**Assignee:** tobiu
**Status:** To Do

**Parent Epic:** epic-enhance-neo-website-seo.md
**Depends On:** ticket-create-sitemap-generator-script.md

## Description

To improve the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand our content, an `llm.txt` file is needed. This file will be automatically generated by a build script to ensure it stays in sync with our content.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Enhance the `buildScripts/generate-seo-files.mjs` script.
2.  Add a function to the script that takes the parsed list of content URLs and formats them into the `llm.txt` syntax (`Allow: /path/to/page`).
3.  The script should write the final output to a new `llm.txt` file in the `apps/portal/` directory.
