# Feature: Add Framework Comparison Articles to Learn Directory

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Developers evaluating or learning Neo.mjs often come from other established frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue, Ext.js). There is a need for clear, concise comparisons that bridge their existing knowledge to Neo.mjs concepts and highlight Neo.mjs's unique advantages.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a new section or series of articles within the `learn` directory dedicated to comparing Neo.mjs with other popular JavaScript frameworks. Each article should focus on a specific comparison (e.g., "Neo.mjs vs. React", "Neo.mjs vs. Angular", "Neo.mjs vs. Ext.js").

These articles should:
*   **Bridge Knowledge Gaps:** Explain how concepts familiar from other frameworks map to Neo.mjs.
*   **Highlight Differentiators:** Clearly articulate Neo.mjs's unique selling points (e.g., worker-based architecture, fine-grained reactivity, performance, security).
*   **Provide Side-by-Side Comparisons:** Use tables or structured sections to compare specific features (component definition, state management, routing, rendering, build process, ecosystem, learning curve).
*   **Discuss Trade-offs:** Acknowledge any trade-offs or scenarios where one framework might be preferred over another.
*   **Suggest Use Cases:** Guide developers on when Neo.mjs might be the optimal choice.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
(None considered, as this is the proposed solution.)

**Additional context**
This initiative will significantly improve developer onboarding, enhance discoverability, and help position Neo.mjs more effectively within the broader web development ecosystem.

**Affected Files (Conceptual):**
*   `learn/comparisons/neo-vs-react.md` (new file)
*   `learn/comparisons/neo-vs-angular.md` (new file)
*   `learn/comparisons/neo-vs-extjs.md` (new file)
*   `learn/README.md` (update to link new section)

The initial versions are in place now, with huge Gemini support. Please open new tickets, in case there might be oversights or inaccuracies.
