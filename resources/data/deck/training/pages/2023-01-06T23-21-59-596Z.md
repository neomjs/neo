#Introduction

In this lab you'll use the city to update the center.

#Steps

??Create a main view model property `city`

We want a default city, and we want the filter to reflect it.

- Define a new data property `city:'Oconomowoc, Wisconsin'` in the main view model
- In the main view, bind the filter's `city` to the new property

You should see that as the city fields's initial value.

??Do the same for category.

- Define a new data property `category:'pizza'`
- Bind the filter's `category` to that property

??Use two-way binding to reflect user changes to city and category

In the main view, change each binding to be two-way bound.

For city it's coded like this. Do the same for category.

    city: { twoWay: true, value: data => data.city }

Test it by running the app, entering a city and category, then using the 
the Chrome debugger to confirm that the main view model reflects the values.

    Neo.findFirst({ntype:'yelp-main'}).model.data.city

    Neo.findFirst({ntype:'yelp-main'}).model.data.category
