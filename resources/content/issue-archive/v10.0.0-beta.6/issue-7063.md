# Learning Content: Read only code block letter spacing

The new theme is using `letter-spacing: 1px` which is arguable.

This also affects the code views:
<img width="531" height="225" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16bac115-2fd4-4339-857c-4d48cdc33518" />

I will remove it here explicitly to get to:
<img width="490" height="221" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c487159e-dd72-4451-93ee-5976400ca9dd" />
