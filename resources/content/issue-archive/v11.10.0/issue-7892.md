# Review and Update JSDoc Comments in Memory Core MCP Server

The Memory Core MCP server (`ai/mcp/server/memory-core`) requires a review of its JSDoc comments to ensure compliance with the updated coding guidelines.

**Goal:**
1.  **Class-Level Comments:** Ensure all classes have a `@summary` tag, followed by an empty line, and then a detailed description.
2.  **Method-Level Comments:** Verify that all methods adhere to the strict block formatting rules (vertical alignment of types, names, and descriptions with correct spacing) and that no empty lines exist between the description and the first `@param` tag.
