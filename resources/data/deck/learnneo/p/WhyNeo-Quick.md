Neo.mjs applications can be written quickly thanks to its syntax, features, and debugging convenience.

- Neo.mjs classes let you specify properties in a way that allows code to detect "before" and "after" changes, which makes it easy to handle value validation and transformation, and react to changes.
- Neo.mjs has elegant yet powerful state management features that make it easy to create shared, bindable data.
For example, if two components are bound to the same property, a change to the property will automatically be
applied to both components.
- Debugging is easy because Neo.mjs uses standard JavaScript, the Neo.mjs class config system, and built-in 
debugging tools. For example, while developing an application you can click on a component, and in the debugger
easily inspect the component and update its properties &mdash; these updates are immediately reflected in the running application.
