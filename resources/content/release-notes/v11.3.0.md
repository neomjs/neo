# Neo.mjs v11.3.0 Release Notes

This release brings significant improvements to SEO, the routing system, and the overall developer experience. Our AI-native workflow continues to enable rapid and impactful enhancements to the framework.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🌐 Enhanced SEO & Discoverability

-   **Comprehensive Example Indexing**: The SEO file generation process (`generateSeoFiles.mjs`) now automatically scans the `apps/` and `examples/` directories to include all examples in the `sitemap.xml` and `llms.txt` files. This makes our rich set of examples fully discoverable to search engines and LLMs. (Issue #7769)
-   **Accurate Sitemap Timestamps**: The `<lastmod>` date for examples in the sitemap now reflects the last modification of any file within the example's directory, providing more accurate information to web crawlers. (Issue #7770)
-   **Improved LLM Context**: The `llms.txt` file has been updated with a more detailed description of the different build environments, giving LLMs better context on how to interpret and present the example URLs. (Issue #7771)

### 🏗️ Framework & API Improvements

-   **Smarter Routing**: The `onHashChange` method in `src/controller/Base.mjs` now provides the matched route pattern as a `capturedRoute` property in the `value` object passed to route handlers. This gives developers more context and enables more powerful and flexible routing logic. (Issue #7773)
-   **Refactored Portal SEO Handling**: The SEO metadata management within the Portal app has been refactored for better maintainability. Metadata is now stored in a dedicated `seo.json` file and loaded via a new `Portal.service.Seo` singleton, separating data from view logic. (Issue #7772)
