# Welcome to neo.mjs! (Beta Version)
This is a new paradigm. If you want to enter a new era of making better Web Based User Interfaces,
the following concepts will be addictive.

## COVID19 IN NUMBERS Demo App
The most compelling way to introduce a new framework might simply be to show what you can do with it.

<a href="https://neomjs.github.io/pages/node_modules/neo.mjs/dist/production/apps/covid/index.html#country=USA">Live Demo: COIN App dist/production</a></br>
Desktop only; support for mobile devices is on the roadmap)

Just clicking around randomly, but might give you an idea on you to navigate inside the helix and gallery.

You can find the code of the covid app <a href="https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/apps/covid">here</a>.

## Online Examples
You can find a full list of (desktop based) online examples here:</br>

You can pick between the 3 modes (development, dist/development, dist/production) for each one.

Still here? Welcome to neo.mjs - The webworkers driven UI framework

## Ready to get started?
There are 3 different ways on how you can get the basics running locally.</br>
Please take a look at the <a href=".github/GETTING_STARTED.md">Getting Started Guide</a>.

## Project History
neo.mjs got released to the public on November 23, 2019.</br>
Before this point, the project was already at 3720 commits.<br>
Find out more about the start of it inside the <a href=".github/NEOMJS_HISTORY.md">Project History</a> file.

## Story & Vision
Although neo.mjs is ready to craft beautiful & blazing fast UIs,</br>
the current state is just a fraction of a bigger picture.

Take a look at the <a href=".github/STORY.md">Project Story</a> and <a href=".github/VISION.md">Vision</a>.

## Sponsors are needed!
Is the current code base useful for you or could it be in the future and you like the neo.mjs concepts?</br>
So far the development was made possible with burning all of my (tobiu's) personal savings.</br>

This is obviously not sustainable, so to enable me to keep pushing like this, please support it.</br>
The benefit of doing so is to get results delivered faster.
