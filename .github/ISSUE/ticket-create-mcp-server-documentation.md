## Description

To enable community contributions and ensure the long-term maintainability of the new MCP server architecture, clear documentation for human developers is required.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new guide is created at `learn/guides/ai/MCP_Server_Architecture.md`.
2.  The guide explains the rationale behind the MCP server approach.
3.  It provides clear instructions on how to start the Knowledge and Memory servers.
4.  It documents the API for each server (or links to the API design documents).
5.  It provides guidance on how a contributor could add new endpoints or extend the servers' functionality.
