# Refine Technical Blog Content Strategy

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-07-27

## Summary

This ticket documents a strategic refinement of three unpublished v10 deep-dive blog posts. The goal of this refactoring is to make the framework's core architectural concepts more accessible and engaging for a broader developer audience.

## Previous Approach

The initial drafts of our deep-dive articles were highly technical and focused on providing an in-depth analysis of the framework's features. While accurate, this format was best suited for developers already familiar with or actively evaluating Neo.mjs.

## New Strategy: Narrative-Driven Technical Storytelling

To better introduce developers to the unique architecture of Neo.mjs, we have shifted our content strategy to be more narrative-driven. The key principles of this new approach are:

1.  **Focus on Engineering Challenges:** Each article is now framed around a core engineering problem (e.g., "How do you render a UI from a web worker?") rather than just documenting a feature.
2.  **Tell a Story:** The content now presents the "why" and "how" behind our architectural decisions, taking the reader on a journey of discovery.
3.  **Highlight Core Principles:** This narrative approach allows us to more clearly communicate the fundamental concepts of multi-threading, performance by default, and developer experience that drive the framework's design.
4.  **Improve Accessibility:** By focusing on the story behind the technology, the content is now more approachable for developers from all backgrounds, inviting curiosity and discussion about web architecture in general.

## Action Taken

The following three unpublished blog posts have been rewritten to align with this refined content strategy:

-   `learn/blog/v10-deep-dive-functional-components.md`
-   `learn/blog/v10-deep-dive-vdom-revolution.md`
-   `learn/blog/v10-deep-dive-state-provider.md`

These articles are now better positioned to clearly and effectively communicate the value and innovation of the Neo.mjs architecture.
