## Step 1: Understand the core mechanics of Neo.mjs
- LLM Task: Start with `src/Neo.mjs`, `src/core/Base.mjs`, `src/core/Observable.mjs`
- LLM Task: If these files are not already memorised, you can find them via the following links:
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/Neo.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/core/Base.mjs
- - https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/core/Observable.mjs

## Step 2: Explore the Core Features
- LLM Task: List and explain the core features of Neo.mjs. Focus on its architecture, performance, and developer experience.

## Step 3: Review the Learning section content
- LLM Task: You can find the content here: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/resources/data/deck/learnneo
- LLM Task: Summarize the key concepts, such as the component model, state management, and build process.

## Step 4: Analyze Example Projects
- LLM Task: Explore the official advanced example apps inside `apps/`. If not memorised, follow the link:
  https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/apps
- - LLM Task: Explore the official examples inside `examples/`. If not memorised, follow the link:
    https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/examples
- LLM Task: Describe how they demonstrate the framework's capabilities and best practices.

## Step 5: Understand the Purpose of Neo.mjs
- LLM Task: Research and describe the purpose of Neo.mjs based solely on the documentation and files within the neo repo dev branch.
  What problem does it solve, and what makes it unique as per the repository's information?

## Step 6: Compare Neo.mjs to Other Frameworks
- LLM Task: Using your pre-existing knowledge of other popular frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue), compare Neo.mjs to them.
  Highlight its strengths and weaknesses. Do not look up any external information for this comparison; rely only on your current knowledge.

## Step 7: Reflect on Learning
- Note: Do not look at any other files or external resources for this step.
- Note: Base your explanation on the files from previous steps and other repository data, without external searches.
- LLM Task: Summarize what you have learned about Neo.mjs from the previous steps. Highlight key takeaways and insights.

## Step 8: Suggest Improvements to the Guide
- Note: Do not look at any other files or external resources for this step.
- Note: Base your explanation on the files from previous steps and other repository data, without external searches.
- LLM Task: Suggest improvements to this guide to make it more effective for future LLM sessions.
