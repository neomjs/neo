# refactor: Remove obsolete buildScripts/ai directory

This ticket covers the deletion of the `buildScripts/ai` directory. This folder contains legacy scripts for AI agent workflows that have been entirely replaced by the new MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Removing this directory is a final cleanup step to eliminate outdated code and formalize the transition to the new architecture.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The `buildScripts/ai` directory is deleted from the repository.
