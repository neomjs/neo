# Refactor AGENTS.md to explicitly define Ticket Closure Protocol

Split the "Git Protocol" section in `AGENTS.md` to create a dedicated "Ticket Closure Protocol".
This emphasizes the "Definition of Done" steps (Push, Assign, Comment) as a distinct workflow gate, preventing omissions of the assignment step.

### @tobiu - 2026-01-08T09:30:02Z

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ Refactored `AGENTS.md` to split the "Git Protocol" into a distinct "Ticket Closure Protocol". This makes the "Definition of Done" (Push, Assign, Comment, Close) explicit and mandatory.
