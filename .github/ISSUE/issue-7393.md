# Move PR workflows to separate guide in learn/guides/ai

**Reported by:** @SarthakJain29 on 2025-10-06

**Parent Issue:** #7364 - Integrate GitHub CLI to Streamline Contribution Workflow

---

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Agents.md is packed with many instructions. Lot of content inside the agents file related to PRs, which is only needed in case the current session deals with them.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Creating a new md file inside learn/guides/ai and moving the PR-related content over there. This will simplify agents.md file

AGENTS.md should then just reference this new guide.

This would improve maintainability and clarity for contributors.

FYI (flash model):

> ✦ Yes, a dedicated PR guide would greatly improve my workflow by reducing cognitive overload. It would allow AGENTS.md to remain concise, 
>   minimizing context switching. Querying for specific PR workflows would become more efficient, yielding targeted results. Updates would be 
>   simpler, maintaining consistency across the knowledge base. This modular approach, separating "what" from "how," would enhance my understanding 
>   and navigation, making my workflow easier and more robust.
