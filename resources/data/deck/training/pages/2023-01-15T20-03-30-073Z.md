`Neo.component.Base` also has a `reference` config.

If you code a component with `reference:'foo',`, then you can get
a reference from the view or controller via `this.getReference('foo')`.

This is similar to using the Neo find methods, but references are
resolved in a more efficient manner and the scope is limited to 
what the view can "see".

<span style="color:lightgray">(Controllers keep a map of references, keyed by the reference name. The <code style="color:lightgray">getReference()</code> method 
uses bracket notiation to retrieve the value from the map &mdash; it's lighting fast.)</span>
