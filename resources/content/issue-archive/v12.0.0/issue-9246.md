# Add DevIndex FAQ Guide

- Create `learn/guides/devindex/FAQ.md` (top-level, alongside `Introduction.md`).
- Add common DevIndex questions and answers, including:
  - "How can I update my data inside DevIndex?" (Answer: Update GitHub profile, wait for the next cycle).
  - "Why am I not in the index?"
  - "How do I opt out / opt in?"
- Update `learn/guides/devindex/tree.json` to include the `FAQ` node at the very bottom of the list.

**Input from Gemini 3.1 Pro:**

> ✦ The FAQ guide has been successfully created and added to the DevIndex navigation tree. It includes all requested sections (updating data, missing profiles, opt-in/out), explicitly clarifies the non-commercial, tracking-free nature of the project, and concludes with a strong 'Get Involved' CTA block to encourage further exploration of the Neo.mjs ecosystem. Closing the ticket.

- Add nuance to the tracking section explaining that while the site doesn't track browsing, the app itself tracks public GitHub data."
