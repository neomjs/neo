# v10.3.2 Hotfix Release

This hotfix addresses an issue where changing the `tabBarPosition` config for `tab.Container` did not correctly update the UI. Additionally, a broader refactoring was applied to improve component lifecycle management.

## Fixes

- **tab.Container:** Resolved an issue where switching `tabBarPosition` did not correctly update the UI. The `tabBar` component's `dock` config now properly reflects the new position, ensuring correct rendering. This fix involved adding `tabBarPosition` to the `config` object, and implementing `afterSetTabBarPosition` and `beforeSetTabBarPosition` methods to manage UI updates and component creation.
- **Component Lifecycle:** Replaced `this.rendered` with `this.vnodeInitialized` across various components (`Circle`, `Gallery`, `Helix`, `Dialog`, `Text` field, `GridBody`, `Flexbox`, `List`, `TableBody`). This change refines the component lifecycle management, ensuring that UI updates and other operations are performed when the virtual DOM node is properly initialized.
- **Font Awesome v7** Adjusted 3 spots inside our theming, where v6 was still in use.
- **Earthquakes Tutorial** Fixed a malformed code closing tag, added a warning that the labs are currently not working.
