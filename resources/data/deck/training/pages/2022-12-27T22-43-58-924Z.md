Note that the way we've coded the app, the grid is _not_ reusable.

You can reuse any class config block by creating a new class that
extends the component's class. In other words, if you want to 
reuse a table, you create a new class that extends `Neo.container.Table`
and uses the same config.

Besides reuse, other good reasons to put your components into their own classes
is make code more abstract, to isolate complexity, and to allow
those to be tested in isolation.
