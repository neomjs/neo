# After Nov 1st: Revert Temporary Hacktoberfest Protocol from AGENTS.md

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-09-28

The `AGENTS.md` file was temporarily modified to include a special onboarding protocol for Hacktoberfest 2025, as detailed in ticket #7303.

This ticket is a scheduled task to remove that temporary section after the event is over to keep the core documentation clean.

### Task:

- On or after November 1st, 2025, remove the "Hacktoberfest 2025 Onboarding Protocol (Temporary)" section from `AGENTS.md`.
