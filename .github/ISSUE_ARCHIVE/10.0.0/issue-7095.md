# Create Deep-Dive Blog Post for the Reactive Core

**Reported by:** @tobiu on 2025-07-22

**Parent Issue:** #7093 - Create v10 Top-Level Blog Post

---

## 1. Goal
Create a detailed blog post explaining the new reactive engine in v10.

## 2. Target Audience
Technically-minded developers and architects who want to understand the framework's core mechanics.

## 3. Key Talking Points
- **Title Idea:** *Under the Hood: The Neo.mjs v10 Reactive Engine*
- **Concepts:**
    - `core.Config` as the "atomic" unit of state.
    - `core.Effect` for automatic, "spreadsheet-style" reactivity.
    - A detailed explanation of the "Two-Tier Reactivity" system, showing how the classic hook-based system is now powered by the new engine.

## 4. Deliverable
A complete draft of the blog post as a markdown file.
