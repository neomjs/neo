# Ticket: Finalize and Document Ticket Archival Process

GH ticket id: #7251

**Assignee:** Gemini
**Status:** Done

## Description

To honor the release of v10.9.0, the ticket archival process is being formally implemented. This involves creating the new archive structure and updating the strategy documentation to match.

## Changes

1.  **Create Archive Structure:** A new directory, `.github/ISSUE_ARCHIVE/v10.9.0/`, is created to hold completed tickets for the release.

2.  **Archive Completed Tickets:** All tickets completed for the v10.9.0 release have been moved into the new directory, with filenames prefixed with their GitHub ID (e.g., `gh7248-....md`).

3.  **Update Strategy Document:** The `.github/TICKET_STRATEGY.md` file will be updated to reflect the use of `.github/ISSUE_ARCHIVE/` as the official archive directory and to mention the practice of using release-specific sub-folders.
