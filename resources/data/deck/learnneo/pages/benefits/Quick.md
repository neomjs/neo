Neo.mjs applications can be written quickly thanks to its syntax, features, and debugging convenience.

## Property lifecycle hooks
Neo.mjs classes let you specify properties in a way that allows code to detect "before" and "after" changes,
which makes it easy to handle value validation and transformation, and react to changes.

## Elegant state management
Neo.mjs has elegant yet powerful state management features that make it easy to create shared, bindable data.
For example, if two components are bound to the same property, a change to the property will automatically be
applied to both components.

## Simple and powerful debugging
Debugging is easy because Neo.mjs uses standard JavaScript, the Neo.mjs class config system, and built-in 
debugging tools. For example, while developing an application you can click on a component, and in the debugger
easily inspect the component and update its properties &mdash; these updates are immediately reflected in the running application.
