# Hacktoberfest 2025: Build Your AI Development Skills with Neo.mjs

## 🚀 Level Up Your Career in 5 Minutes

**Add these to your resume after Hacktoberfest:**
- ✅ AI-Augmented Development Experience
- ✅ Open Source Contributor to Production Framework
- ✅ Next-Gen JavaScript Architecture (Multi-threading, RAG Systems)
- ✅ Published Technical Content (if you write a blog post)

**Hacktoberfest starts October 1st** - Your competitive edge awaits!

## Choose Your Path - All Lead to Success

### Path 1: The Classic Contributor (No AI Setup Required)
Dive directly into the codebase and make a tangible impact. This path is perfect for developers of all skill levels who prefer a traditional workflow. Here are some high-impact ways to contribute:

- **Write High-Quality Documentation:** Good documentation is the backbone of a healthy open-source project. Help fellow developers by adding clear, intent-driven JSDoc comments to undocumented classes and methods in the `/src` directory. **Bonus:** Our AI-native system consumes these comments, so every piece of documentation you write also makes our AI assistant smarter.
- **Build New Examples:** Create a new, practical code example for any component in the `/examples` folder. This is one of the best ways to learn the framework and help others.
- **Strengthen the Codebase:** Add or improve unit tests for existing functionality.
- **Fix Bugs & Refactor:** Tackle an issue from our `good first issue` list or propose a refactoring to improve code quality.

### Path 2: AI-Powered Development (15-minute setup, then fly)
Let AI do the heavy lifting while you learn. The one-time setup takes about 15 minutes and leverages Google's generous free tier, which works in two parts:

- **Knowledge Base:** Building and querying the knowledge base uses the `text-embedding-004` model, which is free for up to **60 queries per minute**.
- **AI Agent:** For interactive development, if you use the Gemini CLI, it uses the `gemini-pro` model, which provides up to **3 million tokens per day for free**.

**1. Read the Guides:**
   - **[Working with AI Agents](https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/.github/WORKING_WITH_AGENTS.md):** First, read this playbook for you, the human developer. It provides essential strategies for guiding the agent and maximizing its performance.
   - **[AI Knowledge Base Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/.github/AI_QUICK_START.md):** Then, follow this guide to build the local knowledge base that the AI uses to understand the project.


This will walk you through building the local knowledge base that the AI uses to understand the project.

**2. Then, just chat with your AI:**
```bash
gemini
> "Help me find something to improve in Neo.mjs"
```

**The AI handles everything** - you just guide and learn!

### Path 3: Content Creator Route
Write about your experience, no coding required:
- Document your Hacktoberfest journey
- Review Neo.mjs from your perspective  
- Compare it to frameworks you know
- Share what you learned

**We especially value blog posts!** They help others learn.

## How to Contribute: The Neo.mjs Way

Unlike traditional Hacktoberfest projects where you pick from a pre-existing list of issues, we encourage you to **propose your own contributions**. This is a core part of our AI-native philosophy: you will use the AI agent as a partner to explore the codebase, identify areas for improvement, and define your own work.

Our workflow is designed to mirror a real-world development process:

1.  **Explore and Discover:** Use your chosen path (Classic or AI-Powered) to find something to improve. This could be missing documentation, a component that needs an example, a bug, or a potential refactoring.
2.  **Propose Your Task by Opening an Issue:** Once you have an idea, [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/new). Clearly describe the work you intend to do. This is your proposal.
3.  **Get Approval and Assignment:** A maintainer will review your proposal. If it's aligned with the project goals, we will approve it, assign it to you, and add the `hacktoberfest` label. **Please wait for this approval before starting your work.**
4.  **Implement Your Change:** Once approved, you can start working on your contribution.
5.  **Submit Your PR:** Link your Pull Request to the issue you created.

This "propose, then build" model is exactly how professional software development works. It gives you a more realistic and valuable experience than simply grabbing a pre-made ticket. While we will still tag a few issues with `hacktoberfest` for those who prefer a traditional start, we highly encourage you to try our discovery-led process.

## What Makes Neo.mjs Different (Optional Reading)

Neo.mjs is the first framework built for AI collaboration. While others bolt AI on top, we built it into our DNA.

**Want the full story?** Read "AI-Native, Not AI-Assisted" on [GitHub](https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/learn/blog/ai-native-platform-answers-questions.md) or [Medium (friends link, no paywall)](https://itnext.io/ai-native-not-ai-assisted-a-platform-that-answers-your-questions-0c08f5a336ae?source=friends_link&sk=45cc238e4f342672d3eb3244136b7770) (or skip it and just start contributing!)

## Example Contribution Workflows

### Classic Contribution: Adding Documentation
This workflow shows how a classic contribution directly improves the codebase.

**Before:** An undocumented function.
```javascript
createVnode(vdom) {
    // complex logic here
}
```
**After:** Clear, intent-driven documentation is added.
```javascript
/**
 * Transforms a JSON blueprint into a virtual DOM node structure.
 * Part of Neo's reactivity system - enables surgical DOM updates.
 * @param {Object} vdom - JSON blueprint describing the UI component
 * @returns {Object} Virtual node ready for DOM rendering
 */
createVnode(vdom) {
    // complex logic here
}
```
*This documentation is now part of the knowledge base, making the AI smarter for the next contributor.*

### AI-Powered Contribution: Learning and Building
This workflow demonstrates using the AI as a pair programmer to learn and contribute simultaneously.
```bash
You: "Find me a component that needs better examples"
AI: "I found Neo.button.Split lacks examples. Let me explain what it does..."
You: "Create an example showing its features"
AI: [generates code]
You: "Explain how this works"
AI: [teaches you the concepts]
```

## Who Succeeds Here?

✅ **Complete Beginners** - "I learned more in one PR than a month of tutorials"  
✅ **Designers** - "I described a UI, AI built it, I learned how it works"  
✅ **Writers** - "My blog post about the experience got 500 views"  
✅ **Senior Devs** - "Finally saw how RAG works in production"  
✅ **Students** - "Added 'AI Development' to my internship applications"

**Only requirement:** Basic Git/GitHub (standard Hacktoberfest knowledge)

## Contribution Ideas by Time Investment

### Got 15 minutes?
- Fix a typo

## The Multiplier Effect

Your contribution doesn't just add code - it makes everyone after you more productive:
1. You document a function → AI can now explain it perfectly
2. You write a blog post → Next person learns faster  
3. You add an example → AI uses it to teach patterns
4. The ecosystem gets smarter → Everyone benefits

This ticket itself is already an example of the "ai native" workflow. It was created as a combined effort of `Claude` and `Gemini` with guidance. I will keep it unassigned, so that it hopefully show up in event search tools.

Hi guys! As the epic mentions: you are welcome to open hacktoberfest tickets on your own. E.g. using the "ai native" workflow, gemini can easily provide you with ideas.

Alternatively, you are also welcome to just ask here for more tickets (ideally with a short summary on what you would like to work on).
