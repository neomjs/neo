  title: Neo.mjs GitHub Workflow MCP Server API
  description: |
    This API provides structured access to the Neo.mjs GitHub repository, enabling the automation of contribution workflows. 
    It uses a hybrid approach, leveraging both the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for simple, direct commands (e.g., checking out a PR) 
    and the GitHub GraphQL API for complex data fetching and mutations (e.g., listing PRs, creating comments, syncing issues).
    This allows AI agents to programmatically interact with pull requests and issues in a safe and efficient manner.

        **When to Use:**
        This should be the first tool you run if you suspect any issues with the GitHub Workflow MCP server. It provides a quick diagnostic check on the server's primary dependency.

        Retrieves a list of pull requests from the GitHub repository.

        **When to Use:**
        - To get a high-level overview of pending work (using the default `state: 'open'`).
        - To research historical context by looking at past work (e.g., using `state: 'closed'` or `state: 'merged'`).
        - To find a specific pull request number for use in other tools.
        - When the user asks questions like:
          - "What pull requests are currently open?"
          - "Show me recently merged PRs."

        **Best Practices:**
        - After calling this tool, summarize the list of PRs for the user.
        - Highlight key details such as the PR number, title, author, and state.
        - Avoid showing the raw JSON output to the user unless they explicitly ask for it.

        **Future Enhancements:**
        Note that a future feature will sync PR conversations to local markdown files, providing a more detailed way to review historical PRs. For now, this tool is the primary way to browse PR history.

      description: |
        Checks out the branch for a given pull request locally using `gh pr checkout`.
        This modifies the local filesystem to reflect the state of the pull request branch.

        **When to Use:**
        Use this tool when you need to locally inspect the code changes of a pull request, run tests, or perform a more detailed review.

        **Workflow:**
        1. **Ensure your current work is committed or stashed.** Before switching branches, make sure you save your current work to prevent losing changes (e.g., using `git stash`).
        2. **Check out the pull request branch** using this tool.
        3. **Review and test the code locally.**
        4. **Return to your previous branch** when you are done (e.g., using `git checkout -`).

        **Safety Note:** Always commit or stash your changes before checking out a new branch to avoid losing work.

      description: |
        Adds a final review comment to a pull request, either approving it or requesting changes. This is the primary tool for summarizing the outcome of a PR review.

        The tool automatically adds a header indicating the AI agent source and prefixes the comment with a special icon.

        **When to Use:**
        This tool is for providing a conclusive, final review on a pull request.

        - **To Approve a PR:** Use this tool to leave a comment indicating your approval (e.g., "LGTM, thanks for the contribution!").
        - **To Request Changes:** Use this tool to provide a clear, actionable list of changes required for the PR to be approved. This should be a summary of your findings after a detailed review.

        **Note on Inline Comments:**
        While this tool is for the final, summary comment, detailed line-by-line feedback should be provided through other means if available. This tool provides the final verdict.

        Retrieves the full markdown content of a local issue file by its number, searching both active and archived issues.

        **When to Use:**
        Use this tool for a fast, offline-capable way to read the content of an issue that is already present on the local disk. This tool reads directly from the file system and does **not** access the GitHub API.

        **Important:** The content returned reflects the state of the issue at the time of the last `sync_all` operation and may not be the most up-to-date version if remote changes have occurred since.

        Creates a new issue on GitHub. This is the authoritative first step for creating a new ticket.

        **Workflow:**
        1. **Formulate:** Determine the appropriate `title`, `body`, and `labels` for the issue.
        2. **Propose to User:** Before calling the tool, you MUST output the proposed `title`, `labels`, and `body` in a clear format for the user to review.
        3. **Call Tool:** Immediately after proposing, call the `create_issue` tool. The user can review the content and approve/deny the tool call itself.

        After the issue is created on GitHub, you can get a local copy of it by running the `sync_all` tool at an appropriate time, such as when you are ready to push other local changes or when you want to refresh your local environment.

        **Labeling Rules (VERY IMPORTANT):**
        - You MUST include the `ai` label on all tickets you create.
        - You SHOULD also include one of the primary labels (`epic`, `enhancement`, `bug`) whenever applicable. Most tickets will fit into one of these categories.
        - For other cases, like `documentation`, use the most appropriate label.
        - Before using any labels, verify they exist by using the `list_labels` tool.

        Triggers the full, bi-directional synchronization of GitHub issues and releases with the local filesystem.
        This is a comprehensive operation that should be run after making remote changes (e.g., using `create_issue`) 
        or before looking for local changes to push.

        **Key Functions:**
        - **Pulls remote changes:** Fetches the latest issue and release data from GitHub.
        - **Creates local files:** If a new issue was created on GitHub (e.g., via the `create_issue` tool), this process will create the corresponding local `.md` file.
        - **Pushes local changes:** Scans for modifications in local issue files (in the active `ISSUE` directory only) and pushes them to GitHub.
        - **Efficient:** Uses a metadata cache and content hashing to ensure that only actual changes are pushed or pulled, making it fast for no-op runs.
