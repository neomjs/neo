# The neo.mjs vision

At this point I (Tobias) can not commit to adding dates to planned items.
After investing 5 years of my full and unpaid working time I am in need to make up on the financial side of things.
So as long as the project is not properly funded, I can only afford to continue working on it in my spare time.

To speed up the current development there are two options:
1. Help promoting neo.mjs or jump in as a contributor (see <a href="../CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing</a>)
2. Jump in as a sponsor to ensure I can spend more time on the neo.mjs coding side (see <a href="../BACKERS.md">Sponsors & Backers</a>)


Thanks for your support!


Best regards, Tobias
