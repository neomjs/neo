# Neo.mjs v12.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Type:** Major Architecture Overhaul & Flagship Showcase  
**Stability:** Production-Ready  
**Upgrade Path:** Requires manual migration for Grid implementations (see Migration Guide).

> **TL;DR:** **v12.0.0 is the "Zero Overhead" update.** We didn't just build a new flagship application; we used it to push the framework's architecture to its absolute physical limits. This release introduces **Zero-Overhead Record Architecture**, **Component-Based Grid Rows**, and the **Stream Proxy**. It represents a staggering achievement in human-AI collaboration: **402 tickets resolved in a single month**, proving the efficacy of Context Engineering.

## 🐣 The Crucible: A Chicken and Egg Story

We originally planned different features for v12. But we realized we needed to massively enhance the core Grid with OffscreenCanvas cell support, granular row pooling, and strict zero-allocation strategies. 

To prove those capabilities, we needed an impossible dataset. That requirement birthed the DevIndex app. In turn, dealing with 50,000 records in DevIndex forced us to push our existing "Turbo Mode" to the absolute limit, leading us to invent Engine-Level Streaming, Soft Hydration, and Virtual Fields in the Data Layer. 

It goes way deeper than a UI update. We executed massive data package enhancements, deep core polishing, and went straight back to the Neo roots: **pushing for absolute peak performance on a level that single-threaded technologies cannot even dream of.** Both the flagship app and the core engine evolved in parallel, at rocket speed. Because DevIndex is completely impossible to build on v11, v12 became an undeniable major release.

## ⚡ The Cyborg Factor: 402 Tickets in 30 Days

This release is a testament to what is possible when a solo developer pairs with a stateful AI agent equipped with a Neural Link to the runtime. 

*   **Total Resolved Tickets:** 402
*   **Velocity:** ~13.4 tickets per day, every day, for a month.

We didn't just write code; we debated architecture, profiled Garbage Collection (GC) pressure in V8, and completely rewrote the core data and grid layers to handle 50,000 active records in memory without a single DOM insertion during scrolling.

---

## 🏆 Hero Story 1: DevIndex & The Data Layer Revolution

To prove Neo.mjs can handle massive, complex data on the client side, we built **DevIndex**—a real-time, in-browser ranking of the top 50,000 (0.03%) GitHub developers. 

*(Note: The sheer scale of this release—402 resolved tickets—makes it impossible to cover every detail here. For DevIndex alone, we have written **26 dedicated guides** (.md files living directly within the repo). These guides cover everything from our Ethical Manifesto and Methodology to in-depth architectural deep-dives on the Data Factory and Frontend design. You can read them directly inside the learning sections of the Neo Portal app or the DevIndex app itself: [https://neomjs.com/apps/devindex/#/learn](https://neomjs.com/apps/devindex/#/learn))*

**The Motivation: The "Invisibility Problem"**
The genesis of DevIndex stemmed from a frustration with the open-source ecosystem: there was no accurate way to measure developer contributions globally. As AI models scrape open-source code without attribution, the human labor behind the software becomes invisible. DevIndex is our answer to making that labor measurable and visible.

**The Backend: A Massive Data Factory**
Because the GitHub API cannot provide this data natively, we built a complex, autonomous backend pipeline called the **Data Factory**. It consists of independent micro-services:
*   **The Spider (Discovery Engine):** Uses a multi-strategy algorithm (heavily relying on a "Network Walker" social graph traversal) to break out of mainstream "Filter Bubbles" and find hidden top-tier talent.
*   **The Updater (Enrichment Engine):** Queries the GraphQL API to aggregate multi-year contribution matrices, carefully managing rate limits and implementing a "Safe Purge Protocol" for account renames or transient errors.
*   **Data Enrichment & Hygiene:** Specialized services compute "Cyborg Metrics" (Velocity, Acceleration) to identify automated bots vs. humans, normalize global locations, and enforce a strict 30-day TTL for failed accounts.
*   **Privacy First:** We built fully automated Opt-In and Opt-Out services (using Issue Templates and Stargazers) to ensure developers maintain complete agency over their presence in the index.

**The "Fat Client" Twist & Zero-Overhead Data Layer**
The DevIndex frontend application has **no traditional backend**. It is a pure "Fat Client" hosted on GitHub Pages. The entire 50,000-record dataset is held in memory within the App Worker, allowing instant, zero-latency sorting and filtering.

Loading 50k records with 60+ fields each would normally crash a browser tab. We solved this with a **Zero-Overhead Architecture**:

1.  **Engine-Level Streaming (JSONL Proxy):** We implemented `Neo.data.proxy.Stream`. Instead of parsing a massive 23MB (8MB gzipped) JSON payload, the grid uses `ReadableStream` APIs to process an NDJSON file incrementally, rendering the UI instantly as chunks arrive.
2.  **Zero-Overhead Records (Virtual Fields):** We redesigned `Neo.data.Model`. The raw data is kept as hyper-compact arrays. The `RecordFactory` generates prototype-based getters (Virtual Fields) on the fly (e.g., `record.y2024` reading from `data.y[14]`). 
    *   Adding 60 new year-based fields adds **0 bytes of memory per record**.
    *   **Dependency Resolution:** Complex calculated fields can now declare a `depends` array. In Turbo Mode, the Store recursively resolves and caches these dependencies before execution, preventing redundant array reductions during soft hydration.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class RecordFactory {
        +createRecordClass(model)
    }
    class DynamicRecordClass {
        <<Prototype Getters>>
        +get y2024()
        +get cy2024()
        +get totalCommits()
    }
    class RawDataObject {
        <<Memory (POJO)>>
        +y: [100, 150, 200]
        +cy: [80, 120, 180]
    }
    
    RecordFactory ..> DynamicRecordClass : Defines properties on prototype
    DynamicRecordClass ..> RawDataObject : Getters read from raw array
```
3.  **Soft Hydration ("Turbo Mode"):** In `autoInitRecords: false` mode, the `Neo.data.Store` holds raw POJOs instead of Heavy Record instances. But what happens when you filter by a calculated field that doesn't exist on the raw JSON? We introduced **Soft Hydration** (`Store.resolveField()`). When filtering or sorting, the Store dynamically calculates only the required fields on the raw objects and auto-caches them, bypassing full record instantiation until a row enters the visible viewport.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Grid
    participant Store
    participant Model

    User->>Grid: Clicks Sort by "Total Commits"
    Grid->>Store: sort('totalCommits')
    
    note over Store: Turbo Mode: Items are raw JSON!
    
    loop For each raw item
        Store->>Store: Check if item has 'totalCommits'
        opt Field Missing (Soft Hydration)
            Store->>Model: resolveField(item, 'totalCommits')
            Model->>Model: Check 'depends' array (Recursion)
            Model-->>Store: Execute calculate() function
            Store->>Store: Cache result on raw JSON object
        end
    end
    
    Store->>Store: Perform native array sort
    Store-->>Grid: Fire 'load' event
```

4. **Performance Theater: The "Show Off" Effect:** 
   * To prove the Main Thread is completely unblocked by the Grid's layout during a scroll, the DevIndex app intentionally **doubles the animation speed** of the complex 3D Luminous Flux header when you scroll. The Canvas worker smoothly accelerates the physics `timeScale` while the grid scrolls underneath it, proving visually that heavy canvas operations cannot block the App Worker's scrolling logic.

## 🏎️ Hero Story 2: Grid Supremacy (The Ultimate Flex)

The DevIndex UI is a torture test. It renders live, animated data charts ("Living Sparklines") inside every single row of a 50k-record grid, alongside complex icon components and country flags.

**The Challenge:** High-frequency scrolling a 50k-row grid pushes data binding and rendering to its limits. Previously, `Neo.grid.Body` acted as a monolithic renderer. While we had component-based columns before, the architecture was fractured. The `Grid.Body` managed the row HTML structure, while each component column managed its own isolated pool of instances. As you scrolled, columns had to calculate their own visibility and dispatch `moveNode` deltas to re-parent their components into the newly rendered row cells. This worked, but it was brittle. It resulted in massive, fractured JSON payloads crossing the worker bridge. More critically, horizontal scrolling destroyed and recreated DOM nodes for cells leaving the viewport, instantly severing `OffscreenCanvas` worker connections (the dreaded "Zombie Canvas" issue).

**The Solution: Component-Based Rows & The Quintuple-Threaded Architecture**

To achieve true O(1) scrolling performance and constant memory usage, we completely shattered the monolithic Grid Body. Every row is now its own standalone `Neo.grid.Row` component, and we aggressively split the workload across five independent actors:

```mermaid

    end

    App -->|Request Data| Data
    
    Data -->|Return Sorted Array| App
    VDom -->|DOM Deltas| Main
    Canvas -->|60fps Render Loop| Main
```

1. **Component-Based Rows & Granular Updates (App Worker):**
   * Editing a record now triggers a VDOM update *only* for that specific `Neo.grid.Row` instance. 
   * **Resilient Lifecycle:** Component columns (like our Living Sparklines) are now standard children of the `Row` component. Because the row itself is never destroyed, the framework's standard lifecycle manages cell components automatically, permanently eliminating the dreaded "Zombie Canvas" bugs.

2. **The "Fixed-DOM-Order" Strategy ("Zero-Latency" Scrolling):** 
   * We upgraded `Neo.grid.Body` to enforce strict **Row Pooling**. As you scroll, rows leaving the top of the viewport are recycled in place via hardware-accelerated CSS `translate3d`.
   * *The Flex (Empirical Proof):* During maximum-velocity vertical scrolling stress tests on the 50k-record DevIndex, we analyzed the exact composition of the VDOM delta payloads crossing the worker bridge.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Mounted Row Range (DOM Pool)
        TopBoundary[--- Top of Viewport ---]
        R1[DOM Row 1: translate3d(0, 0px, 0)]
        R2[DOM Row 2: translate3d(0, 50px, 0)]
        R3[DOM Row 3: translate3d(0, 100px, 0)]
        BottomBoundary[--- Bottom of Viewport ---]
    end

    Scroll[User Scrolls Down] -->|Moves DOM out of bounds| R1
    R1 -.->|Teleported to Bottom via GPU| R3
    
    style R1 stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

   * A peak scrolling frame generated **784 deltas**. The payload contained exactly:
     *   **0 `insertNode` commands.**
     *   **0 `removeNode` commands.**
     *   **784 `updateNode` commands.**
   * This is the definition of a perfectly functioning **DOM Pool**. 

```javascript readonly
// Empirical Delta Log (The "Zero-Mutation" Proof)
// Notice the complete absence of HTML string replacements or structural changes.
[
  // 1. The Container moves via GPU
  {
      "id": "neo-grid-body-1__row-1",
      "attributes": { "aria-rowindex": "87", "data-record-id": "neo-record-50839", "data-row-id": 85 },
      "style": { "transform": "translate3d(0px, 4250px, 0px)" }
  },
  // 2. A simple text cell updates
  { 
      "id": "neo-grid-body-1__row-1__cell-0", 
      "innerHTML": "86", 
      "attributes": { "data-record-id": "..." } 
  },
  // ...
  // 3. Ultra-granular deltas INSIDE a Component-Based Column (e.g. the 'Impact' Heuristics column)
  { 
      "id": "neo-vnode-353", 
      "textContent": "🏛️", 
      "cls": { "add": ["pillar"], "remove": ["bolt"] }, 
      "attributes": { "title": "Consistency: Community Pillar (>10y)" } 
  }
]
```
   * We intentionally trade cheap JavaScript cycles (calculating and serializing 800 JSON objects takes **< 3ms**) to completely eliminate Native DOM Layout Thrashing. Even deep inside complex, nested component columns (like the DevIndex "Impact" badges), the framework resolves changes down to microscopic CSS class toggles (`add`/`remove`) and `textContent` updates. 
   * By using `translate3d` specifically, we force the browser to hand the positioning off to the GPU. Because the strict "mounted row range" limits the total number of DOM nodes, we achieve **Compositor Heaven**: we leverage GPU hardware acceleration without triggering a "layer explosion" that would overwhelm video memory. The browser never recalculates the layout tree because the DOM structure never changes.

3. **"Full Pool Rendering" for Cells (O(1) Horizontal Scroll):**
   * We extended the zero-mutation philosophy to horizontal scrolling. Each row implements a "Full Pool Rendering" strategy, generating a fixed-size array of cell nodes based on the `gridBody.cellPoolSize`.
   * Unused cells are kept as lightweight placeholders (`display: none`). When scrolling horizontally, cells are simply recycled by updating their data attributes (`data-field`, `data-record-id`) and position, without ever altering the VDOM children array length or order.

4. **Main-Thread Drag & Kinetic Scrolling:**
   * We introduced `Neo.main.addon.GridDragScroll`. Instead of passing high-frequency `mousemove` events back and forth between workers, drag-to-scroll logic now runs directly on the Main Thread. It features physics-based inertial scrolling with exponential decay friction, delivering a buttery-smooth, native-like touch and drag experience.

5. **Surgical DOM Move (Drag & Drop Proxy):**
   * Reordering columns containing complex components (like `OffscreenCanvas`) used to be impossible without destroying and recreating them, losing canvas context. We implemented a "Surgical DOM Move" in the `SortZone` proxy. When dragging a column, the App Worker dispatches a sequence of `moveNode` deltas to physically pluck the live components out of the grid cells and drop them into the dragging proxy, perfectly preserving the canvas connections and animations while you drag. They are snapped back into place on drop.

6. **"Living Sparklines" & Zero-Allocation Physics (Canvas Worker):** 
   * We transferred ownership of the `<canvas>` DOM nodes inside the grid cells to a dedicated Canvas Worker using the `OffscreenCanvas` API. 
   * To maintain a strict 16ms frame budget (60fps) without Garbage Collection (GC) stutters, the physics engine uses a **Zero-Allocation** strategy (cached geometry, pre-allocated `CanvasGradient` objects).
   * To prevent GPU overload, it uses a **"Sparse Animation Strategy"**. A single master loop randomly selects *one* chart to pulse with a "Data Packet" every few seconds. This creates the visual impression of a highly active, living system ("The Server Room Effect") while keeping actual GPU load equivalent to rendering just a single chart.

**The Best Part: Zero Migration Effort**
Despite being a fundamental, ground-up rewrite of the framework's most complex component, the new Grid is a **100% drop-in replacement**. All your existing grid configurations, custom cell renderers, and stores will work out of the box with massively upgraded performance.

## 🧱 Hero Story 3: Core Architecture Hardening

To support the massive VDOM throughput of the new Grid, we had to harden the core identity systems.

*   **Framework-wide `internalId`:** Previously, Neo.mjs relied on the VDOM worker to fill in missing IDs for granular nodes (like spans), syncing them back to the App Worker asynchronously. In high-frequency mutable views (like a scrolling grid), this caused race conditions where node identities got swapped.
    *   *The Fix:* We implemented **App-Worker Authority**. The `TreeBuilder` now generates deterministic `internalId`s Just-In-Time *before* the VDOM worker ever sees the tree. The App Worker is now the absolute source of truth for DOM identity, securing drag-and-drop and scrolling stability.
*   **The GC War:** We systematically eradicated `Array.from()`, `Object.entries().forEach()`, and deep array spreads (like `[...largeArray]`) from the core hot paths (`VDomLifecycle`, `TreeBuilder`, `Collection`), replacing them with zero-allocation `for` loops and native `slice()`.

---

## 🚀 Hero Story 4: The Universal Application Engine (Node.js)

While Neo.mjs is famous for its multi-threaded browser UI architecture, v12.0.0 reinforces a much larger strategic narrative: **Neo is a universal Application Engine.**

It is not just a client-side framework. The very same class system, reactive configs (`_` suffixes), and strict singleton management (`Neo.core.Base`) that power our grids perform exceptionally well natively in Node.js. 

We had already proven this in previous releases by building our entire AI infrastructure (our 4 Model Context Protocol servers) on top of the Neo core. In v12.0.0, we doubled down on what worked incredibly well to build something even bigger:

*   **The DevIndex Data Factory:** The massive, autonomous backend pipeline that gathers the data for our new flagship app isn't built with Express or NestJS. The Orchestrator, the Network Walker Spider, and the GraphQL Updater are all Node.js CLI services built entirely on top of the Neo.mjs core class system.

This proves that Neo's architecture offers a truly unified, highly performant development model across the entire stack—from the heaviest client-side grids to complex, long-running backend data pipelines.
