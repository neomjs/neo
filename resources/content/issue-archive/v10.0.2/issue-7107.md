# docs: Enhance Angular comparison article

This ticket covers a series of enhancements to the `learn/comparisons/NeoVsAngular.md` document to provide more detailed and nuanced comparison, incorporating the latest v10 architectural insights.

### `learn/comparisons/NeoVsAngular.md` Enhancements
- Sharpened the "Change Detection" section to better contrast Angular's broad, Zone.js-based approach with Neo.mjs's surgical, effect-based system.
- Refined the "Developer Experience" section to more clearly articulate the benefits of Neo.mjs's "zero-builds" workflow versus Angular's prescriptive, build-heavy process.
- Preserved existing valuable content while integrating these new, more focused points.
