# Neo.mjs v10.1.1 Release Notes

This is a patch release that addresses a critical regression bug affecting drag-and-drop operations in grids.

## Bug Fixes

### Grid Column Drag & Drop

-   Fixed a bug in `Neo.collection.Base` where the `move()` method would fail to correctly swap adjacent items. This was caused by an unsafe, nested `splice()` operation that could lead to unpredictable behavior.
-   The direct impact of this bug was the failure of drag-and-drop for grid column reordering, which is a significant regression.
-   The `move()` method has been refactored to use a safer, two-step approach, ensuring the stability of all collection-based move operations.

This fix restores the expected drag-and-drop functionality for grid columns.
