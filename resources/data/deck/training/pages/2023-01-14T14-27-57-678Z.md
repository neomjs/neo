You've seen that get/set properties (using the underscore suffix)
have `afterSet...` methods.

Recall that `Neo.component.Base` introduces some key properties. 
Since these properties have `afterSet` methods, you can easily
"detect" when those properties change by overriding the corresponding `afterSet`
method.
