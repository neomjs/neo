The `config:{}` is special. 

When you describe a class instance &mdash; like we've been doing in `items:[]` or
setting up the view model &mdash; you're using a config block. That block is applied to
the instance being created.

In a class definition the `static config = {}` is processed by the 
framework<sup><small>*</small></sup> in order to set up the get/set
and lifecycle hooks.

<small>* via the Neo.applyClassConfig() found at the bottom of each class.</small>
