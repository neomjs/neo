# Neo.mjs v11.1.0 Release Notes

This release focuses on two major themes: a comprehensive enhancement of the Neo.mjs website's SEO capabilities and significant improvements to the stability and feature set of the GitHub Workflow MCP server. These changes make our content more discoverable for search engines and developers alike, while also improving the developer experience for our AI agents and contributors.

## Highlights

*   **Massive SEO Overhaul:** An entire epic dedicated to SEO has been completed. This includes the automated generation of `sitemap.xml`, `llm.txt`, and `robots.txt`, dynamic management of canonical URLs, and integration of these tasks directly into our build and release processes.
*   **GitHub Issue Relationship Management:** A new tool has been added to the GitHub Workflow server, allowing for programmatic management of parent/child relationships between issues, streamlining our project management.
*   **Enhanced MCP Server Robustness:** The GitHub Workflow server is now more resilient, with better error handling, improved testing, and a more robust health check system.

## Detailed Changes

### SEO Epic (#7446)

This release introduces a suite of powerful SEO enhancements to dramatically improve the visibility and indexing of the Neo.mjs website.

*   **Dynamic Head Management (#7448):** A new `DocumentHead` main thread addon has been created to dynamically set canonical URLs, titles, and other meta tags, solving duplicate content issues inherent in SPA architectures.
*   **Automated SEO File Generation (#7451, #7452, #7453, #7460):** A new build script, `generate-seo-files.mjs`, now automatically generates `sitemap.xml`, `llm.txt`, and `robots.txt` based on the content in `learn/tree.json`, ensuring these files are always up-to-date.
*   **Sitemap Enhancements (#7742, #7743):** The generated sitemap is now more powerful, including `<lastmod>` dates based on Git history for better crawl efficiency and coverage of top-level application routes (e.g., `/home`, `/blog`).
*   **Integrated Release Process (#7744, #7746, #7747, #7748):** The release process has been streamlined with a new `prepareRelease` script that automatically regenerates SEO files and updates the `datePublished` metadata in `index.html`. The build process now correctly copies these files to all application build directories (`dev`, `prod`, `esm`).

### GitHub Workflow MCP Server

Significant work has been done to improve the functionality and stability of the GitHub Workflow server.

*   **Issue Relationship Tool (#7632):** A new `update_issue_relationship` tool allows for adding and removing parent/child relationships between GitHub issues directly via the server.
*   **Improved Robustness & Testing (#7687, #7714, #7739):** The server's health checks are now more robust, using the `semver` library for version checking and providing better diagnostics when the `gh` CLI is not present. Integration tests are now properly gated in CI.
*   **Refactoring & Documentation (#7720, #7721, #7722, #7736):** The codebase has been improved through several refactorings, and new documentation has been added to guide developers on handling specific server scenarios.

### Other Changes

*   **New Blog Post (#7733, #7735):** A new blog post, "The Context Engineering Revolution," has been published to announce the v11 release and our vision for AI-native development.
*   **Hacktoberfest Contribution (#7488):** A test plan for `component.Label` was created as part of our Hacktoberfest activities.
