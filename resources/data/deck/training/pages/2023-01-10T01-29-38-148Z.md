Neo UI code is written using JavaScript _modules_ â€” `.msj` files.

That's the file type for JavaScript that uses the class system,
along with the ability to hide and share information via _import_
and _export_.

Neo code is _declarative_, where the code describes high-level
things like _stores_, _panels_ or _tables_, without having to 
worry about how those are rendered in HTML.
