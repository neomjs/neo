# Create SCSS for Tickets MainContainer

Create `resources/scss/src/apps/portal/news/tickets/MainContainer.scss` to style `Portal.view.news.tickets.MainContainer`.
The goal is to set `background-color: transparent` to reveal the top-level background gradient.
This mirrors the setup in `resources/scss/src/apps/portal/news/release/MainContainer.scss`.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have created the SCSS file `resources/scss/src/apps/portal/news/tickets/MainContainer.scss` with `background-color: transparent` to ensure the top-level gradient is visible. This mirrors the styling of the release view but uses the default side nav width. The changes have been committed and pushed.
