# grid.Container: create a new example containing a massive amount of rows & columns

* we can probably use gen ai to create the json based data for us
* i am thinking about 10k rows and 50 columns
* the json file should not get added into the neo repo itself, since it would increase the package size a lot, but get hosted & deployed inside the pages repo
